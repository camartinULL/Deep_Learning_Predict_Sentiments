Its a nice smart hotel and pool.. Our room got burgled on the 2nd night of our holiday and later in the week another familys room also got burgled. The receptionists wasnt helpful or friendly and was hardly ever in the reception it was always closed, and also refused to give us our 100 euro deposit back claimimng we had broke items in the room but they couldnt seem to show me what was broken.	Bad
Knocking shop. Ok for a night or 2 if you're posses out your head. Could do with a safe. Tried to charge me twice. Good job I kept my receipt & showed them on my mobile bank account.	Bad
large pool close to beach. full of residents playing loud music, locals arrive weekends and are shouting and playing loud music from fri-mon, no air con, rooms in dire need of repairs and only a 2 ring cooker to use, rude staff, prostitutes outside hotel as well as drug dealers, unsafe, unclean and hotel looks and feels a hundred years old, could go on and on would just say dont stay here...

"Location good, staff bad customer care, food average & rooms good if you get one with a pool view. We sent an email to the hotel prior to going to ask for a room with a view.I said we would be coming to celebrate my Husband's 65th birthday and our 44th wedding anniversary  I told them I wanted our room to be a bit special. On arrival we paid our money and then they gave us our key to our room The room was on the very lowest part of the hotel with no view or much day light. We immediately went and complained about the room and could we please have another one  The receptionist said no he could not change it because they were expecting more people arriving the next day We said that we should be given priority as we were already there. I mentioned my email with my request but this made no difference to him. We had to stay as it was getting late. In the morning we went to the reception to ask about changing our room  again we were refused. The receptionist said come back the next day and maybe the room could be changed but could not promise anything. The next day Monday in the afternoon we were finally given a better room.
Our celebration holiday was spoiled by staff that did not listen or care about us. The new room was better but there was no hand soap just liquid soap in the shower and we had to ask for that to be filled, no plug for the wash basin and the television never worked properly The receptionist said it was the Ariel but we spoke to other guests and they had no problem with their tv. The maintenance man came to fix it he said there was a problem and he would come back to fix it he never came back so we had to do without.   
The puddings were the same every day & the white wine was awful."	Bad
Location good.. desperated need for a revamped. it is stuck in the 1970's. the windows are rotten and drafty. kitchens and toilets are worn out. furniture old.	Bad
Location is excellent. Staff are rude and unhelpful.  Building works going on directly above our rooms.	Bad
"Location is spot on.. Wi-Fi is non existent even though it is advertised and marketed as a free Wi-Fi accommodation.  When I questioned reception they shrugged their shoulders and said it's always like this we hate it too. 
Next, the buffet breakfast is poor.
Finally, the evening entertainment is ridiculous. We ended up leaving the hotel every evening in search of something worth seeing."	Bad
"Location, food. Bed specially mattress
no change of sheets during my stay ""7 days"" !!"	Bad
Location, view, friendly stuff.. Internet in the room doesnt work at all, in the reception was very slow and not all time. Fitness room equipment thirty years old and very dangerous for customers. In our room on the ceiling was some spaghetti (dont ask me how it possible...).	Bad
Lovely weather. Apartment was not clean when we arrived nor was it cleaned properly during our stay ðŸ˜’. Very limited cooking utensils or crockery we were only 3 people in an apartment that could take 5 so poor facilities.	Bad
Lovely weather. Miserable staff but cook was great	Bad
"low medium. we were in the garden as the herrings, hade to be fighting for beds and sun places,
the pools were colds. The location is good. Parking is impossible."	Bad
Low price but still not a good value for money. Very poor beds, very uncomfortable.	Bad
Luis in the reception. cleaning, kitchen facility, you dont read booking whiches, extra bed rusty, carpet so destroyed that it is dangerous for kid, sad that you have nice hotel and no will to make it at least 3 star	Bad
"Main pool out of action due to SCHEDULED work. No prior warning, and no offer of compensation.. My Son and I recently returned from an 8 night stay at the Sunset Harbour Club
in Torviscas in Tenerife.
My first impressions of the hotel were good, and we looked forward to an
enjoyable stay.
I initially booked the hotel because it was in the area I wanted to be and I
really liked the idea of the chilled out, large pool, with pool-side bar.
Now, I was rather astonished to have a knock on our door a couple of days into
the holiday to be handed a print out explaining that scheduled work was to be
carried out on the main pool start from the very next day! â€” this wasn't
emergency work, this was SCHEDULED work, and followed a brief explanation that
during the 'low-season', work like this is often undertaken....
Now, I have been saving for our holiday for 2 years and at no time prior to the
leaflet was I told about these scheduled works (they were scheduled, not
emergency), and I was not given the opportunity to either book and accept it,
or find alternative accommodation; no, this was kept quiet and payment was
taken.
Even when we arrived at the hotel, we wasn't given the opportunity for a
full refund and an explanation about the works.
Selling holidays in this manner violates trade descriptions, where the item /
service offered, has not be given or provided under the full criteria
advertised â€” i.e. a large pool, with pool-side bar.
Not wanting to cause stress through conflict whilst away, and putting on a
brave face to make the best of it for my son and I, we radically altered our
plans to find alternative activities through the week.
I bought my complaint to the attention of both the Sunset Harbour club abd Booking.com; Booking.com did not respond and Sunset Harbour Club, merely said it was normal to carry out work during the 'off season'! this is Tenerife, it's a year round destination!
So basically, it was a tough c**p, we took your money knowing what we advertised was not going to be available."	Bad

"Beautiful hotel, great staff and good food.. Excelente hotel, we had a great time thanks to the lovely and helpful staff, really nice people.
The hotel is beautiful with all you need, we loved the spa with jacuzzi and both swimming pools, the one on the roof has really good views.
The rooms are spacious, modern, well decorated, very clean and comfortable. The big showers on the rooms are a plus.
Breakfast is very good and the restaurant by the pool has great spanish food with good prices. We are spanish, we were looking for high quality food and we were very happy.
We will be back any time because is an extraordinary hotel, close to the FaÃ±abe beach (the beach is a very good one in Tenerife also)."	Good

Beautiful Serenity. The staff were lovely - we had problems with a missed flight and they were very helpful with re-booking our room. The views from Serenity are fabulous - worth the walk up! The pool was lovely and a relaxing place to spend time. The apartment was also beautiful. The shop on the premises was more than good for breakfast/lunch food. I was very happy with Serenity and would return happily.	Good

"Beautiful tranquil place. We absolutely loved this place. It was Heaven as it was adults only (although we did see a child under 16 in there once not sure whether he was just with someone checking the hotel out) but the result of no children and music made for a very relaxing break.
We have returned from there feeling very chilled.
Breakfast was sublime and everyone was so helpful and friendly. 
It is also a perfect location as all the restaurants and bars are within easy reach.
Would definitely go for a pool view next time though."	Good
Beautiful view and very convenient to two sunny beaches. The location is excellent and the pull out couch made a great extra bed so that our friend could join us on our trip.  The resort is extremely clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was good.  We will definitely stay in Bahia Blanca again.	Good

Beautiful villa fit for a big group of friends. Home from home. The villa was absolutely beautiful and fully equipped with everything you need to cook, eat, do laundry and even had toilet roll.

Location was perfect, shops restaurants and bars all in walking distance and just enough for a complete relaxing holiday! We stayed in an apartment right on the pool side and i can safely say when I return I will request this again! It was perfect as there are a lot of steps if you don't get a pool side apartment!	Good

Staff helpful to arrange Soccer match tickets and to find details of Mass on Sunday- Templo Ecumenico el Salvador- highly recommended.	Good
BEST All Inclusive Hotel. We LOVED this hotel. Only stayed for three nights at the end of a longer stay in Tenerife but it felt much longer and can't wait to book to come back. The All Inclusive is great with plenty of choice, the kids club is so good the kids couldn't wait to go each day. The best asset this hotel has are the staff especially the lovely reception staff so welcoming and the BEST Animation Team on the Island (You are all brilliant). So sad to leave and kids are still talking about it.	Good
