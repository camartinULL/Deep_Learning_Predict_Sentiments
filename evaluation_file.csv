:(. Katastrofa!,Bad
"A PLACE NOT TO GO - EVEN IF YOU'RE DESPERATE!. It was unclean.
It was very loud and noisy at night's, very difficult to get to sleep ,people coming in late and drunk,drunken arguments going on,could hear people having sex,due to the walls being so thin.the staff couldn't care less and were no help at all.The rooms are nothing like they are advertised,the place is more like what i would imagine a halfway house for the homeless would be like.it's quite obvious that properties are not checked out by booking.com as any decent site would not advertise such a place,and my opinion of booking.com has seriously gone downhill.",Bad
A place to be avoided like the page.. everything,Bad

"Absolute disregard for the guests, visit any reception or.... Absolute disregard for the guests, visit any reception or request absolutely useless, it is not interested in anything, just to pay and then dropped out. Until today, I deal with reception requirements that were automatic departure day, we the day before departure and have suggested solutions to today not solved, the reception is absolutely false and fake. Absolutely I recommend this resort for access to guests.",Bad
"Apartments were absolutely filthy,run down in a very bad state of disrepair.. Everything.",Bad
Avoid !!!!. The place was dated and unclean the food was just awful and the staff were rude.,Bad
Avoid at all costs. This property is nothing but a hovel. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. It should be removed from your site.,Bad
"Avoid at all costs

No clean towels provided daily

Awful. Wrong information given and no excuses given. Very run down place.,Bad
"Awful. Staff, room dirty, had to wait 4 to check in",Bad
Awful. Sorry everything.  I know it was only cheap and a hostal but room floor was dirty.  As I was taken to room and door opened the handle fell off and door could not be locked properly . It was how ever dealt with straight away.  The manager looked on floor for the screw that cam out of handle by sweeping floor with a broom which was the covered with fluff and dirt .  This did clean the floor a bit but it needed mopping to get clean.   The beds were comfy but sheets and towels were very tired looking and stained. The shared bathroom was a disgrace.  The toilet needed cleaning as did wash basin.  The shower was unfit to use.  It was stained and filthy.  I can understand as a hostel people are coming and going but the walls were paper thin .  Banging and crashing of doors all night . Maybe they need to have retainers to stop doors banging.  Who ever was on duty talked all night .  I had about 1 hours sleep on and off all night.  I felt unsafe due to banging and crashing of something metallic all night from about 1230am right through to 6am when I had to get ready for the business trip I was in the area for .  Don't think you should advertise this for your customers only fit for someone who is going to stay out all night and sleep all day because they have had too much to drink and wouldn't hear a thing due to being in a drunken stupor. Very very poor rooms not even worth 10€.,Bad
awful dirty run down prop5. Everything,Bad
Awful disgusting hotel. I hated everything about this hotel. The clients are scruffy and the staff are putrid the way they talk to you.,Bad
"Awful prejudice staff. Hotel smelled of sewers. Staff were beyond rude and prejudice towards us as a couple. Half of the stay we were without air conditioning and booking.com FALSELY ADVERTISE the pool area. There are two small pools not one huge one!! There are cheaper better hotels, please don't stay here. The rooms are not as shown which we soon discovered is because they have a 'show hotel room' for pictures!! Absolute joke",Bad

"Be careful with this place!. This hotel is really terrible! I don't know how old the place is but it not looks good. I had a room with balcony and the view was at reception roof where is living 15 cats! People who is living there give them food from thems windows. So you can have some on your head ass vell. Cats are really noisy,I couldn't sleep on the night. If U want to have your balcony open they want to come in!One more think i want to warn people for is the wood trap in the toilet. I almost got this on my head when i want to take a bath!! I was lucky then i didn't because it is really heavy! I was complaining about this to women who is working there the longest she said she will call me during the day for talk with me about response but it never happened. Please people be carefully woth this hotel. I don't how how is it possible that they have 4 stars.",Bad

"Booking.. Booking.com and reception staff on night duty on14th January at this hotel ruined out two week holiday and three months of planning!  And caused us major stress since returning!   I have phones booking.com at least eight times regarding our messed up booking!  But they refused to return our calls and now say it's our fault and not theirs,  and refuse to except liability!   When we made this booking I phoned hotel and booking.com to confirm this was for two people and told yes. It was clearly in two names!  It said two adults!  We booked in and receives two armbands and paid our bill up front!  The day before our departure we ask if we owed anything on our bill and were told NO!  but four Hours before we were due to fly back We received a phone call to say they had made a mistake and only charges us for one person they then took a payment off our card again while we were in disputed of this additional charge!      We have Called the hotel at least six times They kept promising to get a manager to phone us!  But no one has bother! We will never use  Bookings.com again and either will our friends and family!!!!",Bad
"Burgled, cockroaches everywhere, rude staff, disgusting rooms......PLEASE AVOID. Awful location on the steepest hill. Entire hotel is on a crazy steep hill nicknamed Cardiac Hill. Rooms seriously run down, Uncomfortable beds, cockroach infestation, bed bugs and ants everywhere, room robbed on 3rd night as burglar easily forced open balcony door. No CCTV anywhere except reception. Security scarce, never once asked to show wristband.  staff (particularly Luis) no help when robbed, never offered a sorry or any assistance. All euros, sterling, jewellery and perfume stolen. Went to local police station, had to wait 4 hours to make a report, policeman friendly and to stated nobody would ever be caught and that ""robbery happens every day at this hotel and is very normal"". When I returned to hotel, Luis stated that he was unable to help as had 700 guests to help! I was given free breakfast next morning after Luis accepted he had given me no help only for waitress to refuse entry until she spoke to a manager, when reporting robbery found that 2 other families had been robbed in same afternoon. was told by Luis that next day manager Eva would help with CCTV, complaints etc but she was unhelpful, refused to contact main manager to get code to access CCTV. Moved to a new room to find cupboard full of dead cockroaches, bed sheets stained and patio door unlocked. Could not wait to check out next day, will never ever return to this hotel or resort",Bad
"Cheap(ish) but not cheerful.... Opposite very loud building site, hotel opposite being built, spoke to reception who moved us to a quieter room on the ground level next to hairdressers. Had to move rooms then a second time due to cockroach infestation climbing the walls next to bed and a family of them in the kitchen, so moved rooms a third time onto the top foot - which was a lot nicer!
Restaurant never opened once, only the tiny cafe of which, the buffet looked very minimal and unnapatising.",Bad
"Cockroaches in room, TV all spanish,  toaster didn't.... Read the anove",Bad
"Cold, damp, basic room. Checking in was poor. The man had only a few English words. And had his earphones on which was rude. I got a room on the top floor. There is no working lights on the stairs. The room itself was fine. The bed was the most uncomfortable sleep I have ever had. The room was damp. And the locks on the doors are incredibly loud so you can hear people come and go. I could hear the couple in the room next to me at it all night. Had 2 nights booked but cancelled second night. Also no bin in the room.",Bad
Deceiving and rude staff!!. Very rude staff. A completely different room was offered than the one we had booked. When asked to talk to the manager - they did not even bother to call him. Do not book here,Bad
"Dirty room with cocoroaches. No room cleaning. No nothing. The poorest yet not the cheapest hotels. 1. The room is DIRTY! And it has cockroach!!!! More than one! We saw them every day on the short three days!
2. The first room we got in got literally no water after one toilet usage. I walked 1 KM (Yes, from our room to the reception it took 15 minutes to walk, because the dusted room phone was not working at all!) to tell the staff, they only say: we will fix it. After I insisted to change room, we got another bigger room, but samely dirty. One big death cockroach was in front of the door. 
3. Shower: after 5 minutes the water gets colder and colder. 
4. There is a computer near the front desk urging people to write ""reviews""regarding their hotel. I wonder what kind of people can sell their insatisfaction to exchange one free breakfast...
5. I know it is an apartment hotel. Still it is a hotel and charge not really less. In the two night of our stay, there is no any cleaning service. I am not talking about towel change which anyway won't take place. 
Because of this hotel, I have grown extreme doubt about the service level of the whole Gran Canaria island.",Bad
disabled people stay away as well as able bodied.. I am a wheel chair user and had informed the hotel when booking. When we arrived reception was closed we had 7 bags and a wheel chair no help available so 2 flights of stairs down 1 flight up and that was only to the lift after the lift only another 3 flights to go to our appt .We had no choice but to sleep there. Next morning after climbing 3 flights of stairs to have breakfast the pool bar was closed and I was exhausted for nothing.  So I asked to be put in another hotel eventually they fave me a room in a sister hotel we has to call another taxi and move 7 bags again. I'll explain the 7 bags we were getting married on the 14th of august .not even an apology I have motor neuron and can't speak only through computer . I have never felt so helpless degraded and utterly dismissed as a human.,Bad
"Disappointment of holidays. There was a unique atmosphere of trying to cash in from the very first ""Hi"" and a request to pay for a stay in advance at the reception to the last days of our visit...   
Be aware of extra charges! as the hotel charges you extra for (nearly) everything: for a glass of water (!!!) at prepaid (""Half board is included"") dinner (don't event dare to dream about a glass of vine for yourselves, or coca-cola for your children), 8€ for parking place (despite the fact that they do have own garage and the fact that in 15 minutes walking distance there is a possibility to park a car free of charge at public places), for safe-deposit, for Internet (2€ for 10 min.), for tennis-court (5€/hour // 2 racket 6€) which is totally empty morning, noon, and night.
There is no air conditioner in the room, stale air and laud mix of dowdy music from outside bars just killing the efforts to have a rest.
The hotel boasts of its swimming pool (you saw pictures already for surely). But there is no possibility to get a sun bed as they all are 'reserved' (by leaving towels) for all day long by guest in the early morning when they pass to the dinning hall to have breakfast.
In short, please don't waist your time and money, don't spoil your holidays staying at this hotel if you come and have chance to pick the hotel on your own. ""Score of this hotel 7.7 from 210 reviews""?!? There are much, much better hotels (and locations!) in the wonderful island for the similar price range!
We will be happy to never ever come back to Hovima Santa María hotel. Save us!",Bad

hotel from hell horrible staff. The staff was horrible ignorant and didnt av the time of day for you the pool never got cleaned all children come out with coldsores never again wud i go to that hotel food was terrible nothing for kids at all,Bad
"How anybody could enjoy a stay in this hotel is beyond me. It's not a 2.5, it's a zero. The buffet meals were a poor selection, very poor quality and a mad scramble to get food. It was common for 'guests' to help themselves using their hands. Baskets of bread and cakes evidently had 'fresh' put on the top (rolls at the bottom were solid, cakes were squashed). ""All inclusive"" means you get cheap booze in plastic cups from 10.00-22.00. If not all inclusive you have to pay for drinks at reception and take a receipt to the bar. €1.5 for a cardboard mini cup of coffee made with sweetened milk meant we could not get a drink in the hotel for 4 days. Ever wondered what happened to all those 10"" TV's used for games? This hotel has them all. Want to watch their advertised ""satellite TV""? Watch Sky News with squiggly lines. No other channels, no chance of changing audio on the few Spanish channels. Leaving property in your room? Maid will leave your balcony door open all day. Free wifi? Yes but weak signal and sitting in the lounge with worn out furniture. Entertainment? Dream on. Go into town? 250 steps down and up again ... or taxis of course. Mugging? Yep, 50 metres from the hotel.",Bad

"I would like to inform about situation, wich happend with me.... I would like to inform about situation, wich happend with me in this hotel. 
I was stay in this hotel from 6 until 8 june 2016. (in rooms Nr 153 and 154). It was my holiday and i spend it on the Puerto de la Cruz beach. 
After check in to the hotel I could see that for dinner you can only come in long pants. Such rules exist in many hotels, and I'm not against them, but long pants I have debts. Wearing a classic men's shorts (below the knee), I went out to dinner. Coming to Dinner June 6th I met a very unpleasant dining worker who in a very rude manner made me a lot bad words and did not want to start up on dinner. But later still let. At dinner he served our table. He showed a dislike to me.
On the second day, when he saw me in the same clothes, June 7, he made the whole idea. He stopped me at the entrance to the dining room, everyone's mind began to curse, to call someone, waving his arms and cause the colleagues. I stood and was the laughing stock of 20 minutes.
I am not against the rules of long pants, but I have their debts. I am a customer of the hotel, I paid for the hotel and received a very negative impression of your holiday.
I think he had to solve the problem diplomatically, because I am his client, without humiliating me in front of all visitors
I like to report that the employee dining room and asked his name at Reception, but the reception employee hid his name, and said nothing. I can describe it - a thin man of 50, a gray short-haired, bespectacled.
I hope my review will see the maximum number of people and the authorities of the employee.",Bad

Electric kept tripping. Paint falling off the bathroom ceiling. Very over priced. The pictures on the site do not show this unit, but better ones on this site. The road is ten meters away from the balcony. Everyone that walks by this busy street looks onto the balcony. The pictures showed the swimming pool. When I complained owner just laughed.",Bad
"My appalling experiences with Yucca Park. I Arrived  with my kids only for them to tell me there was no way we could not have the room that we booked due to a major problem with the room. They attempted to place the blame on me by saying I was not available for a phone call, this was due to the fact I was already inside the plane on my way to Tenerife.They offered us a room which was not availing of the facilities I had booked for. The hotel they offered me was not to the standard that I would expect but I had no choice but to accept given the circumstances. I was beginning to accept being In this hotel room until I came home from my shopping to find one of the providers, Marina in my room cleaning without my permission which is a breach of my security and when I complained they forced me to check out before the agreed time. Overall I am EXTREMELY disappointed with my experience in Tenerife due to these events and would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.",Bad

Breakfast not tasty and every day the same with not much choice.
Dinner we have tasted only at the first day and never again (it was paid).
Cockroaches in the room.
Cleaning was not done properly during last 3 days of stay.
Not recommended to stay during summer. No AC in the room! In order to be able to breathe we had to sleep with open glass doors in front of the  street where people are drunk-noisy.",Bad
"Never again. The rooms were tiny and accessed via a series of three corridors a flight of stairs and a lift. The key card failed on 5 occasions. The noise was deafening at all hours of the day and night and there is no air conditioning. There was also for some bizarre reason, a SOCK hanging from the ceiling.",Bad

never come again. location is different with  the address on the  website....wifi was  super expensive....kitchen  is  dirty,Bad
"never come back. if the owner take care of his buisness i hope he will understand our review and make some conclusions. 
1. you need change half of your staff, especially barmens (Alvaro have to be first). We payed hundreds of pounds for all inclisive holidays and wanted receive service, i even dont say about smile, but how he give drinks, like drop a bone for the homeless dog. It seems like we asked drinks fo free, but we payed for them. If you suggest all incluisive please say to all your staff that we have unlimitted drinks and we payed for them for a week more then their salary for a month. So the mood was awfull after attitude of barmens. And these opinion is  not only mine, everybody says these, but people on holidays dont want to go to the manager and argue, because its holidays. But all people while we were on holidays said that never will come back and tell all their friends dont go to these hotel.
2. you need change bed blankets and pillows. its disgusting  to touch the blanket, they are so old and thousends of people sleep under them, they are very dirty.
3. no intertaiment 
4. you need change your chef in the kitchen. variety  of food is good: fresh vegetables,fruites a few types of meat and fish, but salads are awfull, and all meals cooked ""without soul"".",Bad
"nic to miejsce jest niebezpieczne i stare. Horrible place, never go there, dirty and symely, beercan unde sink and old brushes and paint.

My husband has 18  stitches on hand. He has surgery on tendons I have three children all could die there. The accident happened on the second day after my arrival, the owner told me to brush down the glass and wait until the next day and insert a new glass and did not want to give me money, I had to rent a second apartment. Nightmare. This apartment is not suitable for rent even for free. The person who gave me the key came to the place of the accident of a drunk lady who avoided the policman  and did not pick up the phone. This place is dangerous there is a second window which one day will come out and kill somebody.",Bad

"Not even worth for 1 Euro!. Theoretically, it is a three-star hotel but I have no idea why it received these stars. The standards are worse than in a hostel. We were greeted by ""tight tired"" receptionist! It stank in the room, the electricity didn't work, the bedroom with small top windows was dirty and shabby. The windows were leaking and you could hear everything from outside. You could even smell the cigarettes. Instead of bed sheets we got dirty blankets. The side kitchen was tiny, with no kettle, pots, frying pan or microwave. We got only cutlery for two people and an electric cooker which was out of order. When we complained at the reception, a woman came inside without knocking as if nobody was there. She furiously walked around the room and went out slamming the doors. Later on we learnt at the reception that everything was fine. If you want to waste your holidays and throw away your money you must definetely choose this hotel :(",Bad

No where to sit at dinner...everything was rushed. Quality of food was so bad. Can't emphasise enough how rude the staff were.

"Stay away from this slum!. 2.5 seems to be the lowest I can rate this place, but it certainly deserves a zero. The hotel was disgusting. Our blankets had cigarette burn holes and the pool was filthy. Our room backed on a smoggy, smelly highway and the windows rattled every time a car drove by. There was no wifi whatsoever, and we were given 1 towel and 1 roll of toilet paper for a 5 day stay with 2 people. The pictures looked nothing like our apartment. We had to pay separate deposits for the safe, safe key and TV remote. Staff did nothing to address our concerns and the manager was not on site. We left after the first night as the place was unlivable.
Two weeks after leaving, sending emails and several calls, we still have not heard back from the management. We asked for a refund for the nights we didn't stay, and are simply being ignored.",Bad

Rooms on the ground floor are a disaster, the bed is too small, filthy floor, you have a small terrace, but it's better not to sit there because everyone will stare when they walk past.

The door banging non-stop, guests will ring, owners shout and yammer on endlessly, dogs barking,
phone is ringing, throbbing, pounding a maid who is crazy from 9a.m. There is no sound insulation and disgusting to hear everything. Without earplugs no chance to sleep, and it will not help when the maid starts pounding in the morning. Internet signal is bad and often the connection is very slow.

On the second night the owner installed the fifth bed – this meant I could hardly get out of my bed without stepping on the fifth person. I asked the owner to give us all a discount (because of the fifth bed) but he refused. There was no hot water in the mornings and in the evenings which the owner explained is because they have solar panels and because people staying there use too much water. The common kitchen is very small and both fridges were so full (of leftover food) the doors would not close. In addition the bar next door had live music which meant we did not get much sleep.",Bad

I haven't checked my credit card statement during the stay and unfortunately I paid Miguel second time by cash on the day of departure. After few days I noticed that I paid twice for this stay. Miguel obvoiusly disappeared because I can not contact him untill now. Please be cafeful when paying - there is neither reception nor office.

Would not recommend.  Poor drinks . Plastic cups???. nan,Bad
Wouldn't recommend!. It's not in Costa adeje as advertised! In the middle of a construction site as two high storeys being erected beside the apartments. So noise pollution between 7am and 6pm mon-sat so no relaxation or long lie. Not serviced apartments as advertised! No reception cleaners and wifi not always working.

"AVOID. Very dirty and smelly of smoke room. Smears on the mattresses and  walls.  Spring mattress terrible,  your back is destroyed the day after. Bathtrooms horrible,  without soap,  worse than a campsite. The place ugly and dirty,  corridors dirty. I understand it is around 21 euro per night,  but cannot understand thia total lack of customer attention. AVOID, better sleep im the airport.",Bad
"Avoid like a plague.. Oh, where do I start? Bland and repetitive foods and almost no vegetables - on Canaries, really? If you like eggs, go for it, you'll get them done 6 ways every morning. Our apartment (the most expensive one) had view into other people's rooms, instead advertised sights of the coast. No aircon either, dirty bathrooms, and the downstairs toiled didn't even have a ventilation grate, so it was becoming a twilight zone for hours after every use. No animation program in the evenings. Our room wasn't cleaned for 5 days, we got fresh towels and bed sheets only when we demanded and threatened with chargeback. Nothing for kids but the pool. Kitchen too small for the number of guests - lack of plates and cutlery at the buffet was a norm at every meal, we needed to queue to get them as they were washed. Big climb to get there and far from the city, I don't envy people who didn't have a rental car.",Bad
"avoid this place by all means. The cleanliness of the resort was very poor, due to finding cock rogers in our apartment under the kitchen sink, and worse at the main restaurant where they served the salad. I pointed that out to a waitress who shrugged off her shoulders and did nothing. Now I understand why my 2 little girls suffered from runny stool for 3 days. Staff at the reception where not concerned at all, even after showing them photos. They said it is normal in the summer, but it was not summer yet. They left a spray to spray the area, but still managed to find more cock rogers on the kitchen's sink.
Also, a serious issue with health and safety when few times parosols are blown away, because of strong winds at the swimming pools. It is a meracle no one got injured.
The food was basic. The water melon served every night was inedible.The leftover was recycled to the next day and mixed with salads. 
In my opinion, the whole theme of the hotel staff is to milk money from their customers: by charging a lot for facilities which should be offered either for free or at least at reasonable prices. I.e they charged me for around €2.50/day for using the safe inside the apartment (this is offered for free where ever i stayed in hotels around the world). Rubbish weak wifi internet offered for €6.00/day inside apartments. Electric bikes rented at €10/hr. 
I believe this resort is too expensive (paid over €120/night) for the dirty unhealthy environment, basic cheap food, poor or lack of facilities and for very expensive services.
I do not think I will ever go back to this resort/ hotel again",Bad
"Avoid this place, in particular if travelling with kids or having an ear for music. Every night there was awful noise from the bar downstairs, loud music and torturous singing out of tune till 12, the apartment was not insulated at all (all the windows were shaking in the strong wind we experienced) and we and the children did not have a single night of quality sleep or rest. It was the most terrible experience we had on holidays ever. First we were told it was New Year, but the next days it did not stop. When calling at night we were told we could change place, but then it would cost 30 euro, and the next day they told us there was actually nothing free. The children slept very badly as the noise was at it worst in the bedrooms at the upper floor as it resonated between the walls of the buildings, but when the last day they slept until past nine and I asked a bit of time extra so that they could eat and we could calmly prepare to leave, we were given just 15 minutes to leave. Luckily they send the bellboy to help with the luggage, and he was very helpful. The apartment was on the third floor with stairs although we have asked for the most accessible option. The staff promised a baby chair which was never brought. The baby bed was not in the bedroom when we arrived but downstairs in the living room and we had to put it apart and assemble it again to get it to the upper floor. I had to kill a brown cockroach crossing the floor downstairs. The showers were rather trickling water than showering. The pool was not warmed up when we arrived. The information provided by the reception on restaurants, car hire, etc., was just promoting the companies they work with although they seemed much more expensive - we rented a car at half the price elsewhere. We will never return to this place.",Bad
"Bad hotel staff attitude and no value for money. We stayed at Flamingo 2 night at 190eur/ night. Unfriendly front desk staff and unclean room (sand, full ashtray, broken wardrobe, broken lightbulb and general early 90s look) make people rather pick AirBnB than regular hotel bookings. The lack of professional attitude when we complained we dont have hot water nailed out bad experience and was just a bitter ""goodbye and never see us here again"".",Bad
"Bad review, worst accommodation. Accommodation had broken patio door when complained to host they told me I had to phone booking .com we were locked out with the cleaner and were late going in despite phoning and requesting early check out, bed had broken slays and had to buy new pillows as full of grease!

Bicycle hire wasnt available middle of the day.No information on the booking website about it.
Answer was need to wait for opening 17 30 pm and anyway this is a different company is not they responsibility.They didnt say sorry about it.
They didnt allow me step in the restaurant without long trausers.I didnt know this rules as there wasnt written on the site .Killer summertime and i didnt bring long trausers..
Manager said its written.I asked to show me.They was searching it for 20 minutes.They didnt found.
Answer was:i need to know it becouse its basic knowledge and this is responsibility of booking.com .
They wanted to give me a trausers.
I refused it  of course.
They said :why ?its washed!
I said again :no thanks
They said then i need to buy one.

Ifthey want to proov their right they will turn the facts as they want.",Bad
"Bedbugs!. The ""double bed"" was two old single beds  pushed together with single sheets. We were both bitten by something either in the mattresses or the mattress protector. The apartments were not very clean at all, grubby looking bed and mattress protector, grime in corners of rooms, rust in bathroom. No kettle was provided. There was no air con. 
The area around the pool and pool bar was very cluttered. There was hardly any room to get to the bar so people could not mingle. The tables and chairs were dangerously close to the pool. 
There was no entertainment apart from the barbeque, We regularly stay at La Mirage where the have singers, happy hours, tapas etc...
While we were there, they were building a new jacuzzi. They had a a screen up which was pointless because workmen were just wandering through the main pool area. They could easily have walked around the back of the apartments to allow  guests some privacy. The jacuzzi also looks really deep and it is hidden away in a narrow area between two apartments.  Pretty dangerous in our opinion. 
The staff were ok, not great, what we saw of them. Again, compared to La Mirage where Mandy and her team are always so cheerful and welcoming.
Venus is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. Not impressed. We won't be back.",Bad
"Budget Phoenix nights. The food was no better than prison slopp, how anyone could rate the food highly is baffling. The facilities at a first glance look good but as soon as you get to your room the disappointment begins. Awful dark and grubby rooms, not had a fresh lick of paint in 20yrs. The bathroom was also beyond the standard that any normal person would deem to be acceptable. Disgusting bath and shower, fittings falling off the walls etc. 
The all inclusive option feels like a punishment rather than a benefit, the drinks bar was laughable and the options available were less than budget. The cheapest mixers and fizzy drinks meant we ended up buying our own. 
If you want a cheap trip away then you might consider this hotel. However I'd recommend avoiding it and saving yourself a headache.",Bad
cockroaches galore. cockroaches,Bad
Complete disgrace. Staff were very ignorant building work going on right next door to my apartment when i was after paying a lot of money to stay there i asked them at first for lower level apartment i have young kids money wasted on such a hotel which i thought was lovely they didnt even contact me about the building work that was going on there better privelages given to english people i would not recommend any irish familys to stay there a complete disgrace for what i had paid especialy half board ,Bad

"Dirty, Unhygiencic and Very Old Fashioned Property. I arrived at the property at 2.30pm I emailed them a few days before to say I would be arriving at that time as Reception closed 1 until 4. They acknowledged my request. The gate is locked and needs a key card to get in. There's 3 numbers to ring they all rang out I rang again and a.man answered I explained I was here to check in he then hung up. I then rang booking.com who tried to ring them they didn't answer. I had to wait in the hot sun until 4pm. The place is old fashioned dirty needs a lot of work done to it and my apartment was filthy the bathroom had hairs dust all over a very foisty smell and compared to a lot of nice modern clean places I have stayed in on this island. This is the worst. Do not stay here even if your on a budget it is a horrible place.",Bad
"Disappointed by the rave reviews and won't stay here again.. Initially very hesitant to stay in apartment due to a misunderstanding over payment that the owner did not advertise clearly on booking.com.
Owner wasn't friendly over the phone when this concern was raised before we arrived and for us it was made an issue 4 days before our holiday.very short notice.
All was ok and owner was friendly enough in person. 
However we were asked to put laundry away from previous guests(not my duty)
Photos make the apartment look bigger than it actually is.
Very bad damp problem in cupboards and bathroom also a fowl smell from drains.
We also had no water for most of one of the days. Not good when it's 40 degrees and you cant shower or flush the toilet.
Ants in kitchen. Living room uncomfortable and not an apartment to spend too much time in. The terrace is better than the apartment.
We had a very early morning flight and confirmed this in advance. The owner did not however say she would arrive 50 minutes earlier while we were trying to sleep so this was very fustrating and then proceeded to damage inspect the apartment including the bedroom while i was getting changed.
Also she then made us leave earlier than the agreed time and we sat on a wall ouside in the middle of the night waiting for our taxi while the owner sat in their car. Totally unacceptable. 
All in all its ok but disappointed by the review scores which lead you to think that it's far superior to the reality.
I'll make sure that I book somewhere with many more reviews.
We have stayed in a lot of hotels and Apartments with booking.com that are always over a 9 rating so we know this isn't of that same standard.",Bad

I almost could not sleep few  nights due to serious knee and back pain. I was blessed by god it wasn't my pregnant girlfriend . After the accident I went to the reception to report it. They got someone to put a towel on the tile and they told me that they will send someone to have a look at it on Monday and the incident happened on Saturday . I asked I want your manager to contact me on Monday regarding this issue. I waited and waited all day Monday then contacted the reception on Tuesday, I was made to wait for the manager 30 mins . Still no sign on manager then I realised I am just wasting my time here. What a disgrace of a customer service.",Bad

Restoran staff need to learn basic english (juice, coffee, egg, still water, sparkling water,) and good good service manners.

Like standard cheap and small Spanish hotel with many oldie people. Interior like basement, separate beds on our honeymoon, only one shampoo and shower gel for all the stay. The other hotels on gran canaria for this money is 10 times better.",Bad
"Everything.. Everything. I am not a fussy person, but after 12 hours of travelling, I
just wanted to dump my bags, freshen up and charge my phone. I was given
a room on the third floor, no lift. When I got to the room, the solitary
power point was broken. I was then given a room on the second floor. The
walls were covered in mould. If I had a dog, I wouldn't let it stay
in this hotel. Without doubt, the worst place I've stayed in.

"Expensive,horrid food and service. 3 out of 4 of us got FOOD POISONED and when we simply asked for hot water they told us the kitchen was shut and we could get it somewhere outside the hotel.

Good location but overtly priced for the facilities. The staff was acting overtly smart. The place overall is very old and is not maintained well. The facilities seems a little outdated and needs a lot of work to upscale for the price that is charged.,Bad

Incredibly noisy, the rooms are not cleaned for a few days, I saw cockroaches. Very far from the beaches. If you have the opportunity to finance - do not stop here.

-breakfast was awful. there are not many choices and they look very cheap. some of them were tepid.
-there are very loud music at hotel bar till 12am. it was so noisy. you could even dance in your room with that music. not very wise choice if you have little ones.",Bad

Never again!!!. Improve the standard of food n increase the variety also to bé shown some appreciation,Bad
"never again.. EVERYTHING. The 'restaurant' smell was revolting, the food was disgusting if you looked around everyone survived off bread and butter, the cleaners didn't clean just moved some things around to show they were there. The drinks were diluted, the entertainment was a guy in a home tracksuit who spoke like he was half asleep and forced to be here. The wifi was not free, changed towels twice over a week period.",Bad
"Never go back. Expensive! Room so dirty, housekeeping is not cleaning room at all,just changing towels. 2 separately beds so uncomfortable, sheets with holes, fridge with over left food,everythere dusty, dirt,just poor hotel.",Bad
"Nice pool. -Booked apartment room with fully equipped kitchenette as I wanted to cook for my 7 month old daughter. There was only a cooktop, bar fridge, kettle, two cups and two spoons. Had to beg/argue to get a microwave and it took 4 visits to reception to get some pots and pans and cooking utensils. They still couldn't provide me with a cooking knife/sharp knife so I had to use a table knife. It appeared that they had raided the kitchen and provided me with broken items that the kitchen didn't want to use. 
-They provided a travel cot that was completely torn down one side and very dangerous, however they did replace this upon request. 
-The room was not as advertised as there was no pool or ocean view. It was below ground and there were no windows in the bathroom and one that didn't let in light in bedroom, which meant that there was a strange smell. Water also came in down the wall in the bedroom when it rained. 
-My husband got gastro from the buffet.
Not a great stay.",Bad
"Nice to walk down to the ses.. We hadde ants in the kitchen in our bungalow. It was also a strong ugly smell inside, so we didnt spend much time inside.",Bad
No shops near by No evening bar or entertainment round the pool. Poorly staffed. We booked for 2 apartments was told that was a recommendation not a booking and was given 1 apartment and 1 studio They both had Ants in kitchen and bathroom area,Bad

Internet included in the price of the room, but not internet.
Hard bed without overmadrass, but had to pay for a superior room.
One person in the reception, long time to wait.",Bad
"Noisy, very dirty and unhelpful staff.. I'm afraid to say, I have stayed at many hostels around the world, but this has got to be one of the worst and surprising. It was very noisy at night, due to the walls being paper thin and could hear other guests coughing, chatting, listening to music as if in the same room. 
Cleanliness was a major issue as I saw old cigarette butts under the dusty bed, with cockroches walking around the room, and mattress was also very worn. The receptionist was not very helpful when asked basic questions such as directions around the neighbourhood. I would not stay here again.",Bad
"Noisy,dirty, smelly, broken furniture and bathroom fittings. rundown, poorly lit, broken furniture , dirty, cleaning equment and rubbish bags left lying about in corridors, primitive communal washing facilities, broken showers and floor tiles. no bin emptying in room or cleaning, sheets and towels not changed during 7 day stay. extremely noisy day and night, always woken by noise at least twice a night.",Bad

Towels paper thin and frayed.
Furnishings pathetic.
Bathroom tiling chipped with the grouting disgusting.",Bad
"Not for us.. Baby cockroaches all over the apartment...god help people going in the summer! I had to have my daughter sleep with us in the bedroom. We stayed one week in an apartment in Maspolomas and never saw even one. Had one night here (to break up our holiday and to visit Puerto Rico) and we saw loads. My husband even stood on one outside the door.  I know you get them in hot countries but it's not nice to see them in your apartment. WiFi was very expensive and can be easily accessed in the many bars in the Europa Centre. We had friends staying for the whole week here on an all inclusive and they thought it was great. If I was here a week I feel i could give a better, more extensive review so maybe just take my review with a pinch of salt as we were only here a night whereas others can give you a more constructive review. I can only tell you what we experienced for a very short space of time.",Bad
Not good. My son s room 301 smelled terrible I would have not been able to stay in that room,Bad
"Not recommendable at all, to avoid

Cleanliness - extremely dirty, noisy, depressing",Bad
"Not worth it. Never seen a member of staff, couldn't complain about the infestation of bugs in bed and in kitchen area. No pool bar or restaurant as expected from the description before we arrived, it is all privately owned, nobody on holiday like us, we didn't spent one day at the pool due to having nothing around and nowhere to get a drink or food!",Bad
"Not worth it!!!. Horrible and repetative food, poor quality. The room was dirty and the cleaners didnt change the towels with days. In the websites the rooms look good but in reality they are very old and worn. The pool is like a green swamp on every 3rd day... There are not enough beach beds around the pool. The alcohol at the bar is extremely poor and cheap. No imported alcohol. The food at the restaurant is too bad for the all inclusive price you pay. Not to mention we found 4 times spoiled food... Everywhere in the hallways you can see cockroaches. Disgusting! Also no free wifi at the rooms, no towels for the pool, you pay 1 euro per day for 1 towel! And 1.30 euro per day for wifi which is extremely slow in the rooms. Also no free water in the fridge and the tap Water is bad for drinking. I am never going to spent my money there ever again!",Bad
"not worth the risk. did not find anything satisfying, went all inclusive, food was horrible, requested a double bed instead got 4 single beds, rooms was horrible. No cleanliness about them at all",Bad

"Nothing
. This is a terrible hotel with a dishonest manager. It is a disgrace and
one should be aware. In all the years in which I got excellent hotels
through Bookin In, I had never had such a terrible experience. The
quality of the services are a real problem, the food is bad, and the
room is not clean but the main problem is the dishonest manner in which
this hotel is being managed. There is no connection between the price
you pay online and the extra costs. They try to charge extra for
everything and you feel that you are being manipulated and tricked all
the time. If you need towels, sheets you have to pay, if you want to
drink during meals- you have to pay, the usage of internet that does not
work after you pay is also a problem. There are no hot waters in the
room and after asking for help you get no response. Once you complain
the answer is that they are not responsible- every problem should be
addressed to Booking In. We had a terrible time in this hotel and we
left after four nights to a wonderful hotel booked through booking In

"Nothing . Location , filthy , food poor , ",Bad
"Nothing actually. I payed 20 Euros for 7 days of Wifi and it never worked. On Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday they did not come to clean my apartment. On Friday they did but they didn't do my bed. The apartment was full of cockroaches and everybody outside was very loud at all times (including in the middle of the night). Awful. Never again!",Bad
"Nothing really , bed was uncomfortable and not a double like.... Noise from the viewing point across the road was awful , gangs of teens hanging out there every night drinking shouting and reving up cars went on till
the small hours",Bad
"Nothing, Ants and cockroaches are anywhere, no reception,.... Nightmare. Ants and cockroaches are anywhere (table, bed, floor). We could not leave food on the table even for five minutes. We cooked a pizza and put on the table while we are preparing salad, there were hundreds of ants on the plants only five minutes, Disgusting.
The staff and the landlady are rude, they are all telling lies. No reception, they said there would be a lady waiting for us before we arrived, but there no one when we arrive the apartment, have to call them for three or four times, as there was no now answer the phone. It was not too bad as the owner arrived 5 minutes after we reach them.
But check out was a nightmare. We asked where we could put our luggage after we checked out because our fight is late night, they said we could stay in the apartment until 6pm on the day of our fight. We have booked the transfer at 6:30. They called us 5pm one day before we check out, asked us to check out 12 the day we leave, and we could leave the luggage in the apartment. But we want to discussed how do we get the luggage back at 6pm, they hang up the call. We tried to call the office and landlady for 3 hours, they do not answer the phone. They sent us an email through booking.com, gave us notice to check out at 12 the day we leave.
Ok, the booking policy said check out 12, we decide to check out at 12, and do not leave our luggage at the apartment, because we are afraid we could not get our luggage back on time for our flight. There no reception and they do not answer the phone, we do not have the key. We will late for our fight or loose our luggage if they do not open the door for us.
We were ready for checking out at 11am on the day we leave. We called the office and landlady at 11am want to check out. Once again, no one answer the phone, called many times during 11 to 12, count reach them. The landlady answered the phone 5 to 12am, and told us she only can arrive the apartment at 1pm.",Bad

Outrageously priced, staff very rude and unhelpful due to a general feeling of lack of morale as they are very short staffed, only 2 machines actually worked in the gym, and worst thing was the fact that there was a room filled with guns and rifles unmanned for several hours on the way back to our room.

So in my apartment was around 35 degrees, smells like I was slipping in the kitchen and all night air pump was working.
Apartment didn't has air-conditioning, no ventilation at all. Kitchen small and seems not clean at all. Fridge was nearly broken and didn't work properly.

Stay away. A place like that mustn't be open to the public!,Bad
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!. Everything was bad! If I knew, I wouldn't book this awful hotel in the awful location.
There's nothing that I liked about this hotel. My advice to all people who consider travelling to Tenerife is to book a different hotel and stay away from this location. It is a very small town where nothing much is happening and most of places shut at 10 or 11pm. Shops are shut at 9.30pm.
There is a lot of crime in this town and we didn't feel safe walking back to the hotel in the evenings. Don't be fooled, there is no beach in this area. Its some black pebbles and rocks. We had to take a bus to Los Cristianos every day. Their beach is amazing and clean. I would advice to stay either in Los Cristianos or Las Americas area. Beautiful beaches, lots of restaurants and shops. Even the local Taxi driver said that this hotel is bad. It is actually not really a hotel. It is a residential complex. Local people live there. Rooms were full of ants and cockroaches. We stayed for 4 nights and our bedding was never changed. Drinks at hotel bar are overpriced! All furniture is dated and rooms don't have double beds. Instead you sleep in 2 single beds next to each other. So if you are a couple,then you can't even give your partner a cuddle. Very bad holiday and bad experience.",Bad

Terrible hotel dont go there. Everything was abselutly terrible! When we arrived they said the hotel is full and sent us to an other 3stars hotel!! Than we came back the day after and it was terible! Very dirty there is no sea view. Small cold pool no area for children. Very very bad food,Bad
"Terrible hotel! Stay away!. We were travelling a group of friends with small children. Our airplane was cancelled and we arrived the day after (we informed the hotel about this). When we arrived one day too late the hotel had given 2 of the group's PREPAID rooms to someone else!! At 9 o'clock in the evening our friends were standing in the reception without any place to sleep. The receptionist gave us no excuse and he didn't help us to find another hotel. They finally found another hotel themselves.
Louzy service both in the restaurant and in the reception! In our family we are 5 people (2 adults and 3 children - 10-14 years old). We got our 2 rooms, but when we pointed out that the extra bed we had ordered in one of our rooms was missing, the guy in the reception claimed that we only ordered 2 beds in both rooms! We finally got the extra bed, but this should be an unnessessary discussion for a family of five with three children and two rooms.
The hotel had HORRIBLE beds!",Bad
"The day we left!. Lot of noise from Poolbar  until midtnight and opposite Sol Y Paz Karaoke-Bar until about 02.30 am. Bathroom with mold and the roof leaks when it rains. Rusted knifes.Old tattered towels. In the apartment no water is wasted by cleaning.  WARNING: Sol Y Paz indicates the price in Euro, but if the credit card is charged then they charge you in your local currency. ($, £ or DKK) This is outrageous. Had to pay 30€ more than advertised. We will never come back to Sol Y Paz.",Bad
"The place looks attractive.. The hotel is a massive sprawling complex takes 15-20 mins to walk from one side to the other. There's only one entrance/exit so be prepared for a LOT of walking. The double beds are actually twin single beds and very uncomfortable. The ""bungalows"" are actually three-storey buildings, with virtually no sound proofing. I certainly won't be staying here again.",Bad
"The receptionist is polite and spoke English good.. The bed not clean, I found hair on the bed.
Bar staff couldn't speak English, if a staff can't speak English who can't wort at a 4 star hotel.
The breakfast is horrible! I didn't even have appetite to eat.",Bad
"The view from the living room was charming.. We are a mixed young/ mature couple on honeymoon, and the ""hostess"" was very nosy and curious. Came unannounced through the terrace (we had panorama windows) to observe us.
And even entered the premises and started to turn off the light while we were in the room, saying: ""you don’t need that light"" - I am week sighted and needed the light.
Cleaning lady entered the apartment without knocking, and without waiting, and she could have caught us in intimate situations - but luckily she didn’t. We asked for a washing machine, but the ""hosted"" just said: "" you don’t need that, you are on holiday"" and when asked again she just repeated her answer and did not provide us with information about where we could have our clothes washed. Very greasy handles were just denied with the remark:"" that is rust"". 2 days after our arrival a man
 from the staff entered the apartment by his key in order to deliver a safe-device. I was changing trousers, which he could see - never the less he just walked right through the apartment to hand me the device, though he undoubtedly could see, that I was holding my trousers in front of me with both hands. The terrace was in ground floor, and in immediate connection with the garden, and ""hostess"" and staff regularly came right into the living room trough the terrace instead of calling upon us through the front door. There was little or no respect for our privacy - and consequently there was not much honeymoon about our stay. The television only had german channels and german spoken shows - most with dubbing.
The terrace was roofed and only had sunshine in the morning from 9 to 12. And there was no heating though the apartment was rather cold due to a firm wind the called La Calima, which blew fine sand from Sahara over the Atlantic and right to the island. We were informed that the payment would be drawn during our stay, but the hotel had drawn the money 5 days prior to our arrival.",Bad
The weather. Everything,Bad
The worst food I have ever tried to eat and cold. Food is vile,Bad
There was nothing to like about this place.

not possible to sleep there. On the second day we could not use the
toilet anymore because the sewer line was broken. The owner did not
answer the phone, did not solve the problem. We did not get our money
back! We were forced to rent a new apartment with our 3 children. This
apartment does not deserve any stars. The only things that worked were
the tv and Wi-Fi. We do not recommend this apartment!

wont stay again and will tell friends  to avoid especially  booking  with booking. com had terrible. Service and too much noise located next to kasbar. Food was awful and cold. Plus problems with return  transfers to airport booking .com awful.Shall not use this company again and have advised many to avoid.,Bad
"Worst accommodation ever. The food at the pool was appalling. We were there for 5 days and the bed wasn't changed. We had to buy our own toilet rolls. And we got clean towels once and no small towel for your hair. The pillows were very flat,but we stuck a blanket underneath",Bad
"WORST APARTMENTS EVER. Kitchen hardly had any utensils, really dirty basic apartments, extremely uncomfortable beds, whole apartment was stinking, asked if we could be moved but was told 'not possible' reception stuff where NO help at all,",Bad
Worst hotel in MaspolomasPLAYA should have 1 star. nan,Bad

"Would not recommend even if I was paid to stay there.. It was awful ! Noisy from heavy door latches banging ,scruffy with holes in bedding and only a single sheet on our three quarter size bed. I didn't feel safe there as I saw a half dressed man using the female bathroom .I recommend you avoid !",Bad
Wouldn't recommend staying here. Poor location. Grubby decor. Tiny pool. View of wall from balcony. No fan or a/c in room.nothing like pictures on web site.,Bad
"A Nightmare Experience....... There was no hot water to take a shower as there was a problem with the hot water system, eventhough we complained there seemed to be no interest in getting it fixed. Also there was a cockroach in the apartment. There was a dog in the apartment next door that never stopped barking hence making it difficult to sleep and have an enjoyable holiday. The terrace got no sun at any part of the day as it was shaded. The apartment is not a holiday complex and is a full time residential area thus having no holiday atmosphere. We had to check out after less than 24hrs as our holiday was turning into a nightmare. Avoid this property if you want to enjoy your holiday.",Bad
Fantastic. nan,Bad
"Rooms were cleaned everyday
. Once you paid your money , you got the distinct feeling that you were
the last person that was welcome at this complex . The pool bar(only
bar)refused you an actual glass for your drink , even at night, which I
thought was especially insulting to the ladies, even thougt it was self
service the constant use of plastic cups cheapened the occasion and
would certainly wear on you after a few days. Turns out you got a glass
if you bougth a drink from menu.(plenty of waiters but no waiter
service) The all inclusive meals, were the absolute basic that I have
come across. Very limited choice , only one (1) buffet counter, the same
on both sides, mostly salads and cold meats, very little choice of hot
dishes most of which were pastas or rice dishes. Drinks self service and
at the entrance of dining room. Tableware, self service, including
napkins and for all meals (not worth € 800.00 + for self service
buffet,not of aanyone's money) Breakfast and lunch was the same
unpleasant ritual as dinner. At night it can get cold at this complex as
it is enclosed on all sides, and the only bar is the pool bar at the
opposite end of complex to reception. There are many steps to negotiate
in this complex and some ramps, but it can be hard to do so for anyone
that is elderly or infirm. The only block with direct access from
reception is block e , blocks a, b and f have many, many steps to climb
to gain entrance. The pool is ""policed""until 9am every morning
by an overzealous pool guy who will remove all items from sunbeds
immediately. The pool itself was not cleaned during the week spent
there. There are cats roaming the complex and drinking from swimming
pools, lots of broken tiles around pool deck.

"terrible. Disappointing, the bedroom had two single beds two single quilt covers no quilts one dirty old double quilt with no cover , sheets old and very worn , asked for clean ones no one came back to us bedroom curtain only a voil light shone through all the time, patio furniture should have gone to the dump all it was was very old living room furniture, No English tv at all . living room wicker chair broken, bathroom old loo brush more dirtier than loo, rim around shower dirty, patio doors never locked, all in all very run down and up for sale,",Bad
Adequate  one star accommodation. There was no change of bed linen or towels or removal of rubbish or additional days cleaning foc. Hot water tank was half size.,Bad
Got stuck in the lift twice once for 45 minutes and then had.... I loved the hotel but it was never written don't once that the hotel wasn't finished and had only been opened one month and there was still work going,Bad

"... could of been good, don't pay upfront
. Up on arrival we checked in having paid in full before arrival and was
very surprised to have my credit card photo copied both sides, my
signature my home address, and copies of our passports been taken . I
explained that I wasn't happy with all this information been held
for any one behind the desk to take. I was told it was company policy
and checking couldn't be completed with out it . Unhappy I
cancelled the card the following day ! We paid for a deluxe room a
4star hotel, the first room was overlooking the hotels over flowing
bins in arguably the worst corner of the hotel. We asked to move saying
that we had booked and payed for a deluxe room . We then were given a
room on the 9th floor overlooking an exclusive pool area, Which we were
not allowed to use ?!? Our pool and facilities were at the other end of
the hotel which doesn't sound like much if your not familiar with
the hotel layout. This involved taking 3 lifts and around a 300m walk
not ideal with a 6month pregnant wife. We payed the extra money so that
we were near to the facilities because of this . Very very poor . Hope
this helps

"A lot of money for a mattress on the floor. Apartment was cleaned poorly once in 11 days. King size bed was a mattress  on the floor. TV had 2 British channels , both news. Stairs in apartment were very steep and dangerous and meant sitting at table was awkward.",Bad
"A terrible surprise!. Everything! Not an apartment, a studio!!  60,00€ a nite!!  Island Village Heights is undergoing renovation, pool closed. It is a residential property, very shabby. Was told beforehand I had to pay with cash not cc and he didn't really want to sign receipt the next day after I'd been to the bank. Taken in through disgusting back entrance, not Reception. He could not tell me how I was going to leave the key and get out through the locked door on departure. I figured it out myself. He sent me a text at 0.45 am on Sunday nite when he knew I had to get up at 6am to drive back up north for work.  Worst experience I have had with Booking.com.",Bad
"Absolutely DO NOT stay here!!. Paraisol itself has 2 bars, 2 restaurants (or cafes) and no beach, coupled with building works in every direction. Come back in 5 years and this place might be habitable.
The apartment is on 15th floor (so don't forget your towel if you go to the pool) and was moderately average. Do not be fooled by the pictures of the pool area. See my attached pics for the real deal! Fenced in like a prison and no facilities available. No bar, no restaurant, no toilets! it is a building site! If you enjoy sunbathing with workmen walking past with ladders and cement bags, you might like it here!!! Otherwise, DO NOT BOOK THIS APT!!! It is cheap for a reason!!!
Totally hoodwinked!!",Bad

After complaining about twinbeds in the room they upgraded.... Everything was old and very used as furniture . Plastic chairs on balcony. Tv -no flat screen didnt work the remote was placed in another room not in our bedroom,Bad
"Apartamentos Roslara - not recommended. Everything except pool area. Too many steps with a lift that only services the centre part of the apartments, there are steps to it & from it further down. The place was dirty, there were drink cans at the top of the stairs down to our apartment number 14 that were still there when we checked out. It looked like someone had dropped a drink & it had never been mopped up, as it was sticky at the top of a flight of stairs.. There was rubbish outside our apartment door & someone must have broken a necklace as there were black beads from the bottom of the stairs to the apartment door, we were in the bottom apartment, and there was no access to anywhere past our door. The fridge/freezer had leaked across the floor and there was half a bag of soggy frozen chips left in the freezer. The kettle leaked all over the worktop and also spilled down onto the floor. There were bugs, the place was too hot, you would need to rent a fan to cool down the bedroom to sleep. The wardrobe was rotten at the bottom & there was a smell of urine in the living space, we could not work out if it was the sofa or what the floor had been mopped down with. Good sunny balcony area, but easy for someone to jump over into. Unsteady path down to the beach, better to use the pavement or roadway outside. No-one to help with cases, it is certainly not suitable for anyone unsteady on their feet or unable to climb stairs. We couldn't wait to get out and generally we would put up with a couple of bits not always being up to standard, but this was a joke. Thank god for small mercies that they didn't have another apartment to move us to.",Bad

"Avoid it!
. Before I start let me say that we always stop at budget places anywhere
we are........
 Price to value is one thing, however this ""place"" is below any value. The worst place (Hindu runned Hotel in Faro) we ever stopped was better and quieter that this one. There are two types of the rooms in the same hotel. Refurbished and old ones. We've got the old one and it started:
It is hard to open the room. It is unbearably hot, we've got a room with a view to the side of the building on the roof tops of the restaurants and shops.... and a night pub. It was so noisy in the night that it  was above our level of percepcion. The cleaning stuff does the job so good that everything left outside is either ""cleaned"" or hidden. 
It was our honeymoon and they new it (all other hotels on the same trip gave us more than we expected), despite we asked to be moved to a different room they refused and said we should pay the difference for a different room if we want. What should be more important for anyone reading this we didn't choosed the chepeast room from the offer so be warned.
Only one good word may by said about the all young and night stuff which was very helpful, despite that: AVOID it if you want to sleep in comfort.

Dubble bed mean two single beds on wheels, so thru the night you are driving in room on your bed and also have problems with sleeping because bed is one of most uncomfortable beds i have ever seen, i wont even mention pillows.  Rooms are not properly celaned and they clean them 4 times a week, so you will find some bugs and ants inside. Pool area in very old and for me discusting.

road was really loud and echoed through the apartment. We were directly
facing the bars across the road! The music and shouting from the bars
carried on til early hours of the night - 3am or so. Reception staff

There are not enough towels on the complex so be prepared to wipe in the same ones as the maid will put the dirty ones back on the rail. Went to reception a number of times asking for clean towels may have them the day after if your lucky and then you'll only have hand towels and not enough of them. Most of the staff need to learn to smile and the rubbish around the pool bar including food  is a disgrace ,not surprising though when there are no bins. Beware if your eating from the pool bar as nobody likes washing their hands after sorting out the bins.

At 6am the cafe in the street below opened and we heard everything about the local street cleaners weekend for an hour or so, after that we decided to get up. The whole place has been 'touched up' recentley, you can tell by the badly grouted tiles and dodgy silicon work in the bathroom. When we went to check out we were literally handed our documents without a word. I said 'is that all?' (I wasn't sure if the bill had already come off of my card), he grunted. I then asked if they'd like to know how our stay was, there was another grunt, I recounted the above and was told it would be passed on to the manager.

The breakfast was so bad you couldn't eat any of it the fruit juice was so watered down you didn't know what you were drinking as it had no taste. Our room had the smallest Telly you could get and our patio had no lock so you could not leave anything of value in the room. It was the worst experience we have ever experienced thank god it was only 3 days.,Bad
Fine but not again if I had a read the reviews I wudnt have went.

"Great location, but terrible stay. The Rooms decore, they didnt have double rooms with views as per the website stated, all rooms were very dated, the safe wasnt included as per the website, the hairdryer in the bathroom was broken, the light in the bathroom didnt work, the airconditioning in the  bedroom chose when to work and when not to, the staff was not friendly when had problems, the door to the balcony wouldn't lock. While there one of the lifts was out so constantly had to walk up and down stairs as at some point had to wait 15 minutes and still no lift.
The overall facilities were dated, our rooms was not cleaned two days with no apology or compensation. 
What was meant to be a nice break away with my otherhalf was tainted by the stay we had at the hotel. Our package was inclusive of breakfast but due to the poor facilities, the coffee machines and jucie machine didnt work properly half the time and the overall food was  just not appertising at all.",Bad
"Grinned and beared it but NEVER again. Rooms dirty - took 3 days to get a cleaner to do 
Fridge old & broken but replaced same day
No TV unless you pay, No Internet unless you pay, No safe unless you pay. 2 rooms broken into while we were thre , no security and no information from hotel regarding the rooms broken into.

Other times we had to stuff our trash to what we could find near. (Small publicity trash bin). So no cleaning existed. Only a broom. Noice levels from the neighbouring visiters were really loud and you had to use ear plugs during the night. Even in the bathroom you could hear the normal Sound of speech from the next door. Pool was really small, approx 3 m width. Location bad, too mutch walking if you wanna go to town...",Bad
"Hotel does not deserve a four star status. Waited 2 hours for the room. The room was meant to be ready at 2pm but wasn't ready until 4pm. Staff didn't even apologise for the wait and inconvienece. 
Bed was extremely uncomfortable.
No facilities in the room such as an iron or kettle. If you required any of these facilities you had to rent them which wasn't cheap at all.
Had to pay for the use of the room safe. 
Internet at the hotel was temperamental.
The room was next to a lift and it was very noisy and disturbed our rest often.",Bad

Hotel owner was only interested about money and was stiff.... nan,Bad
"Hotel rooms very spacious and bright quite modern.. Lack of facilities, lack of character or life in the place. Poor attitude and unhelpful ness of the staff. Rock hard beds, lack of cleaning of rooms and changing of linen and towels.
Very poor location nothing outside or close by, no shops bars or restaurants. We are lucky no one in our party had walking difficulties or was in any way disabled. To far out of anywhere, if you want a very very quiet, out of the way place, if your in a rambling club this is your place.",Bad

"It's relatively close to the beach. Definitely not a 4-star hotel. Big, communist-style building but tiny rooms, w/ a stale, musty smell. The bathroom was not properly cleaned before we got in - you could still see some hairs of previous guests in the sink. 
The breakfast offers very little choice - v tricky for vegans or vegetarians to find sth decent to eat. 
Wifi only in the reception area. 
The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful. 
They charge the credit cards beforehand, when you make the booking, and they keep all your credit card info in their system - I tried to have mine secured but they refused. 
Would definitely not recommend it to anyone or go back there again.",Bad

The kitchen cupboards were falling off and the fridge at the bottom was rusty, ants crawling all over our food and all the electric blew whilst having a shower so I fell getting out of the bath in pitch black, for a self catering apartment you then have to hire a kettle toaster microwave and TV per day, we were moved to a different apartment the following day after being very upset which was lovely but no one should be expected to go through this before hand. The evening receptionist was very nice, however the day receptionist was extremely rude, their was no reason for this, I said the patio doors were not secure and could be easily opened from outside so I asked for a safe key, he then said that their would be a charge, if the property is not secure then that should be their responsibility, some of the resorts are residence and are taking their children to school early or are getting ready for work so don't expect a Sleep in if your a light sleeper.",Bad

"Never again. . 
- the apartment is very very dirty!
- bathroom really needs to be renovated
- they need to buy a new toilet brush (I have never seen what a 20 year old toilet bush looks like.. Unfortunately I know now.
- the security guy is nuts
We arrived very late at night so we tried to inform them about this via booking.com and an email. We have never received an answer so we called them (she did not speak English on the phone !! I had to ask my Spanish colleague to ask her on the phone how we could enter the apartment). They told us the security guy would be there to let us in. When we arrived in the middle of the night we were trying to find this security guy. No one there...We were glad when we found a note on the reception door. It said: ""please find your name and apartment number on the list, your door is open (key inside of the door) please come by in the morning to show your passport.
At 3.11 am we heard someone bouncing on the door. Very loud! It was a guy that was yelling. We went to the door and he said he was from the security and we needed to show our passport. I told him that we we read we needed to show our passport the next morning so this is what we were going to do. He did not stop knocking for about an hour. I told him several times I was not going to open the door. We were two young women alone and we were not sure if this was even the security guy. We decided not to open the door for our own safety. The security guy became louder and louder. And I don't think he speaks a word of English so he never understood a word of what we said. By the way we tried to call his phone number (which we found on the reception door to be sure it was him, but no one ever picked up the phone. We got very scared after a while because we thought it was a drunken stranger. We called the police. The police arrived after 30 min. We found out it was the security guy after all. The police had to calm him down.
The next morning we woke up with a beautiful view.",Bad
never stay there !!!!. What did we like that would be the question,Bad
"Nice hotel ruined by poor staff. complained about air conditioning three times. Nothing done.
Asked to upgrade room as we were on level two.I stated I would pay the difference however was told no rooms available. This was not true as I spoke to a couple who booked the hotel two days after our arrival  they had been able to book a 4th floor room
The reception staff were poor. The bar staff by pool could not crack a smile if their lives depended on it.
The rose wine was served warm at lunch. when I asked for ice it took 30 minutes to arrive!
I have never complained before about any hotel. This hotel is very nice but ruined by poor staff.",Bad
"Nightmare. Constant noise,filthy apartment,sink plugs missing,deceased light bulbs,certain parts of my apartment closed and locked with no access.clubs having their rubbish collected at 2am and streets being cleaned at same time.
Will never stay at this hotel or aera again.constant pestering by illegal street traders to buy rubbish",Bad
Nightmare. Nothing about it i liked. I checked out after 5 hours. You get what you pay for. I went to airport and slept there. Place was a dump. Sorry but true.,Bad
"Nightmare. The apartment ruined our holidays. The furniture and also windows and doors are in an appalling state. You cannot touch armrests of the sofa and armchairs without disgust as they are black with dirt and grease. You can feel metal springs when you lie on mattresses. Thin blankets look like rags. The insides of the wardrobes prevent you from putting anything in there. In the kitchen, we found two cockroaches and plenty of small ants. However, the worst thing was the ventilator from the opposite apartment running beyond any noise limits, going on and off for 24 hours, so even with closed windows it was impossible to sleep normally. Forget about using the terrace unless you like to feel being in a factory. It is really shameful to offer such conditions to visitors even taking into account it is supposed to be a budget accommodation. I have used maybe 40 places through booking.com before with mostly positive outcome, but this one was by far the worst. Some call Tinerfe Gardens a value for money. I would call it a total waste of money.",Bad
"No nite life in town hotel in need of a lot of work. Everything I'm not normally fussy but location was rubbish in relation to night life but that wouldn't matter if hotel had more evening atmospher but it didn't. the hotel itself was disheveled and in need of a lot of work for example the ceiling in our bathroom had a damp patch that had obviously been there a long time, a piece even fell out. The restaurant had no atmosphere, it was very bright and very loud with no type of sound deadening, there so many thing the hotel needs! The breakfasts were ok, Lunches filled a hole but dinners had no quality or imagination.",Bad

Really not recommend!",Bad
Not again.... This appartment was old and needs to be renovated urgently. It smells very strong from the sewerage in the bathroom and in the appartment is only minimal equipment available.,Bad
"Not for families!. Almost the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.
It’s suppose to be a family hotel. I stayed there for 7 days with my wife and baby of 10 months old.
The worst thing – our room was dirty. I asked to clean at least floor properly as our daughter couldn't walk yet and was spending all her time on the floor. And in 30 minutes her feet, clothes and toys became grey because of dirty floor.
I asked 2 times on reception and 2 times they promised me to clean my room. But that never happened.
There are other things which make your stay there ""unforgettable"" in a bad sense:
- noisy. During the day there is loud music from the pool and until midnight on the stage.
- breakfasts are not good. The only good food there was bread, butter and fruits.
- the worst coffee I've ever tried
- kitchen in the apartment is poorly equipped with very old appliances
- bath is damaged
- there is no ventilation in the bathroom
- twin beds are standing on wheels and moving (family apartment?!)
- sofa is also consists of 2 parts which are not tied
- there are just 2 electrical plugs in the apartment: one is in the kitchen, another one is in the bathroom",Bad
"Not for the Disabled!!!. Due to my disability.. We left Europa the next day and booked into another hotel. Europa was down a hill, no way could I walk up to the top. Also our bus transfer driver dropped us of at the top. Said it was too narrow for his bus.. Absolute rubbish. It was a struggle with all our luggage.  The brochure said it was 2 min from the Yumbo Centre more like 2 mins from the beach.",Bad

"Not recommended. Very old, bathrooms were old, no soap or shampoo was offered.
One bed was very old, towels were old, we considered that a 4 star hotel should never be that old.",Bad
"Not worth the money. The music from the street restaurants and bars was really loud and continued until 2 a.m. every morning. It was impossible to sleep without ear plugs on and even with them the noise was loud. The staff was not very interested in this problem and the service was not friendly. We can not recommend the big 5 bedroom apartment to anyone, who wishes to sleep well on holidays. There were cockroaches in the apartment.",Bad
"not worth the money find someware else!. stopped for ten nights,no change of sheets or towels ,appartmentthere where 5 people in the apartment we where left ONE roll of toilet paper never cleaned infestation of ants in kitchen area,tv broken when we arrived reported three times got no response so gave up no wifi when we arrived it was promised reported three times on forth report it was installed

for the price I expected more
also this is a great place to go if you like an early morning fight for a sunbed",Bad
Nothing. The Pool Bar and Resturant were never open,Bad
Nothing about this hotel appealed to me.. STAY AWAY !!! The room itself was supposed to accommodate 4 adults which was in no way accurate as it was no bigger than a studio apartment. Beds uncomfortable. No air-conditioning.  Ants and cockroaches all over the place. Location was miles away from the beach  and the main shopping area. I will never book this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.,Bad
"Nothing at all.. We arrived on a Sunday for our 10 night holiday and straight away spotted long hairs on the floor in the bathroom and in the stairs inside the bungalow. Gave them the benefit of the doubt being a Sunday. By Tuesday the hairs were still there, asked reception to have this issue addressed and the hairs were still there by the 10th night when we checked out. Bedsheets only changed once, on night 9 out of 10! Food below average. Would not recommend it to anyone at all. Definitely coming back to Gran Canaria. This was our 16th time in the island. Never again to Vista Flor. Worst hotel we have ever stayed in.",Bad

Room is spartan, white walls, no color in the room, no decoration at all, feels like prison.",Bad
"Only suitable for families on a very low budget. The first bungalow we were given was facing the road and the patio door lock was faulty. The second we were moved too had a plumbing problem and the bathroom smelt of sewage for our whole stay. Doors are not flush, so cockroaches can access. The bar overlooks a car park and the twice weekly karaoke echoes round the small complex way past midnight. The beds are the equivalent of single camp beds, one actually had a plank of wood instead of springs.",Bad
"Outdated and dirty,not worth the price charged.. The apartment was very dirty, we found  hair in the bathroom and kitchenette, pillow presented various stains even the towels had holes.
No worth the price!!! I do not reccomend  it at all , lots of alternative over there...",Bad
"Outdated hotel and bug infested.. Better quality furniture ,the television did not work and all the power went off for 7 hours.the rooms were very dirty and the cleaners are dirty, I watched her do the bathroom with the same dirty cloth.yes and do the toilet with it then the wash basin, we had to ask for fresh towels and beding. Because they said only one change of bedding a week.i could go on???",Bad
"Panoramica review.. They have a big problem regarding cleaning.
We've been  forced to check in,  even when we told them that we are not happy with that room, because of the location and later on  that first day we discover mold on the wall behind sofa which now left me with a beginning of a cough. The receptionist did not care about this mold problem as it was something normal, like  some dust in a corner of the room.
We requested another room but without any success. The receptionist told us that they are fully book and the only way to solve this problem is to make an upgrade to apartment.
When i book my holiday nobody told me that i will be treated based on my nationality or on my origins.
My question is way is not any kind of historical problems files for all the rooms in this development or why we do not have the chance to chose the room number  from  the beginning of our booking process?
In front of the reception you are forced to  accept whatever they give you  because otherwise you won't gonna see any money back.
We've requested a room with view to the seaside and all we received was a tree in front of out balcony and a room full of mold. We could not enjoy the sunset in our room or to sleep without curtains because everyone passing by in front of our room could see everything in our room. Imagine how is to have the curtains close all the time when you are in the room. Your freedom to do whatever you want in that holiday it is just taken away from you.  This is room no 128 and nothing more.
I had an accident by the swimming pool but the lifeguard didn't had a clue that  any accident in the swimming pool should be keep an record about it.
I won't recommend you to use that 3 metallic ladder to go in and out of the pool. They are slippery.  Use the main one and you will be save for your holiday. 
The studio it is quite big and we appreciate the concept of the building  but it is  very clean less.",Bad
Peaceful stay with very basic accommodation. Reception and bar was closed for the whole of our stay. No signs of any staff members apart from cleaners for the first 3 days. Bungalows were in need of updating and refurbishment.,Bad

"Poor. This is a residential area with the odd apartment rented out. We had a good holiday. BUT please note the following there is NO shuttle bus, reception, restaurant, bar or bistro. This apartment is just across the road from a very large building site which each block contains 630 apartments. The heavy building machinery ie concrete breaker the noise after 10 days drove us crazy. The work started at 6 am and stopped at 6 pm 6 days a week!!!!. There is only 4 restaurant and 2 pubs. So to find a decent restaurant and entertainment will cost you 40€  a night!!!.  The cab from the airport is 37.50 €. We arrive at the apartment the front door was locked got a txt to say someone is on his way with the keys. He turned up 20 minutes later did NOT Speak a word of English. The apartment needed updating. Pls note if you have small children the washing m/c does not work NO air con toaster broke NO claner NO towels etc. The good thing was the weather. This place is miles away from any holiday resort.You feel like you need to do a massive food shop for dish clothes, washing up liquid toilet rolls etc etc. You have been warned. We never saw or heard from anyone in 10 days. So NO receptionist to ask about anything. There is 2 very cold swimming pools and 7 sunbeds!!!!!!!",Bad

Very poor cleanliness - Ants everywhere 
The air condition/ventilator was making constant noise (definitely not normal as it was quite loud) and despite complaining the answer we got was - that is how it is in all rooms since the systems are old and we don't have any other room vacant.If you prefer - you could switch it off and leave the window open.
All in all - not worth to be tagged a 4 star hotel.",Bad

"rethink this hotel. - rooms are extremely old, probably 25 or more years
- stains and odd fixes in bathtub and whole bathroom in general
- prehistoric TV with almost no usable channels. Although watching TV is not a high proirity for us on vacation, sometimes you want to lie down for an hour and watch something.
- aircondition did not work at all. Talked to reception around 3-4 times. After two days of explaining, we got new room
- In the new room the fridge did not work, same procedure. Five or more times at reception
- receptionists have a huge language problem, they barely understand english. You try to explain a thing, they keep repeating the sentence they learned without any logic. With some luck, we got receptionist later who was able to speak a bit of english. Perhaps they merely have non english speaking guests here.
- aircondition has a schedule, it works from 14:00 till 02:00. So mornings and nights are hot. But if you go out for the day as we do, it is not so big of an issue during the day. Although I would expect from a four star hotel to have aircondition also at night, so you do not wake up at 5am and go opening the balcony because you have 27° in he room. And this is the superior room, for which we paid the upgrade fee.
- mattress on the bed insanely needs a replacement
- cockroach in a bathroom this night also drastically reduced our opinion about this hotel, he was big and by big I mean almost 2 inches (4-5cm).
- spa needs to be renewed. Sauna has broken wooden parts, I fell into bench after sitting onto it. Smells bad. Jacuzzi had dirty water.",Bad

Terrible place to stay.. Kitchen being locked at times.Big hill to go up to hostel.Lighting in dorm was hardly able to read.,Bad
"Terrible service!. Staff, lack of towel and linen changes, air conditioning costs 1 euro per hour and stuff uses the credit even if it was not on. Reception spoke little English and we were lucky if they worked 10 hours a week. Despite leaving a week early the moody manager refused to allow a friend to take over my room without paying a second time.",Bad

"The hostal in town.. pillows are old and dirty, very far from beach.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT PLEASE",Bad
"The hotel has natural swimming pool.. The reception guy was unpleasant. He was surprised that we did not have
the vouchers, as he could not check in us without this paper. Hm,
strange that we made a reservation via booking.com and he should have
known about that... Then we were asked to come back to the reception in
45 minutes to pay for our stay (we did not do it, as the receptionist
did not know how much money they had to charge us...), it was impossible
to pay in the evening...
Moreover, the breakfast was bad. 
The hotel itself is extremely old and needs to be renovated and refurnished as soon as possible. TV showed strange English and Russian channels. Very strange choice: nothing to watch. 
Kitchen: there was gas oven without matches. The gas smelled everywhere after we boiled the water... The kitchen equipment was dirty. There was not tissue to clean up the plates, etc. 
We are sure that 86 euro per night for such service is too much! We would not stay in this hotel again for sure.

"the location. Dirty and unsafe. Lights hanging from the ceiling just attached to wires, unfriendly staff and extremely poor services. Internet wasn't working at all",Bad
"The location. I had to hold the shower head with my hand as the clip for the shower head was the wrong size, there was no hot water and the drainage was bad. On requesting to leave and paying for a night stay an error occurred that caused the payment not to go through although I discovered that they'd taken over a grand out of my account, it took the duration of my holiday to get that back and although Booking.com were quick and efficient dealing with it, I'm still left 77p short once they eventually paid it back! It taught me the importance of remaining vigilant even though on holiday. With so much taken out of my account and them not being able to provide alternative accommodation, my holiday was ruined and I had to desperately find a friend who I'd met at the same holiday destination previously to stay with.",Bad
"The location. Construction work taking place on a wing on 4th floor, sending dust towards pool area along with the use of power tools all day, ruined our holiday. Staff denied it was in the same hotel so we took photos. Terrible behaviour from a large chain of hotels. Room dated, fridge cost 5.90 euro, safe was 35 euro. More expensive than anywhere else. Breakfast tasteless, staff unhelpful.",Bad
"The location is good.. Loud music is playing till 1 o'clock a.m. in the pub at calle c. We were in calle d and it was like somebody was sitting with a drum next to us.
New towels were put into the bidet.
Only two rolls of toilet paper for three adults. No soap.",Bad
"The location of the hotel was its only saving grace. The hotel had closed the pool bar for refurbishment which we was not informed about until arrival. Our room was located a few yards form the pool ( pool was slimy and green) area and so heard constant bang bang bang from early morning until we departed after only one night.
The beds were not stable proper beds when lifting the mattress we found a frame with material straps across - this I regard as a camp bed , if I wanted to sleep on a camp bed I would have gone camping.
The whole room was like stepping back into the 1970's.
Kitchen pan was dirty and the bathroom was so old it looked like George and Mildred would appear from behind the shower curtain.
The balcony although it was on the ground floor Room 509 looked directly onto the apartment in front with a small window which was always open, it was like being put into a cell.
We complained to the manager who was helpful but was unable to give us a better room which we would have willingly paid extra for or produce proper beds. We got a refund and left. If the hotel rooms were modernised and air conditioning installed, the pool had clean water in it this would be a pleasant hotel due to its prime location in the cheaper part of Costa Adeje",Bad
The Location was nice. The Service was terrible and the staff unfriendly,Bad
"The microwave - it was the only clean bit of equipment in.... Rented 2 rooms in Dec.Found both rooms in this state:
 Dirty bedsheets, hair on pillows, smelly duvets
 Rooms in basement - dark and dingy, like entering a cave.
Very dirty bathtub - rust marks
 Shower head sprays water all over the place, but not on the intended person.
 Hot water intermittent
 Very noisy - no sound insulation whatsoever, couldn't sleep at night, due to phones ringing non stop at reception, people shouting all the time.There was absolutely no attempt at controlling the noise. All the noise was from within the building - it was very quiet in the street just outside the apartments.
Kitchen area - not adequate for even basic cooking
 Of the 2 burners on the cooker, 1 didn't work.
 No chopping board, knife, washing up liquid provided
 No exhaust in kitchen, all cooking smells stayed in the room.
 Fridge was in a horrible state, the freezer was so chock full of ice,  the  door wouldn't even stay closed.

"The pool area was nice and the surrounding areas were nice.... There was no kettle so had to improvise with pots of water, the towels were like sandpaper and the water often went cold when having a shower the food offer was basic and not very appetising to look at the restaurant was unclean and the staff were not friendly. I would not stay there again.",Bad
"The pool area was ok and was modern.. The apartments are very dated and need updating, beds more like camp beds . The bar was in the car park would definatley not recommend to my friends.",Bad
"The room was dreadful, we asked to move rooms, there wasn't any space, the very kind receptionist mo. The room was dreadful! Nothing more to add!",Bad
"The room was large, indeed.. It feels like a third age-retirement residence. Not that there is
anything wrong with old people, but it's not what you are loonking
for when you are (thinking to be) going for a romantic stay with your
partner. The food was very ok. We had halk board included but had to pay
for the drinks. The ""MINIBAR"" you find in the description of
the hotel is a cheat! There is no minibar in the room unless you want to
buy their 'packet' which consists in some drinks so that they
will install the minibar in your room with those drinks. Unbeliavable.
Stakk is very friendly in the dining room but at the reception they
don't care so much about clients and are quite arrogant and
unhelpful. Position is really bad if you have a car (as we did). It was
impossibke to find it the first time, you cannot drive to the hotel
street by car (we learnt this afterwards) and the hotel has no parking
so it happened all the time that we had to look for a parking space in
the street and took ages to find, especially in week ends, as there are
tens of cars looking for a parking at the same time and it's hell to
find one. There is no beach nearby the hotel, only some black rocks you
cannot even walk on. In front of the hotel there are some swimming pool,
but it's not for free. All in all I would not recommend this hotel,
and if any, take one with the parking inside, it will save you lot of
time, energy and anger!

"These apartments were within walking distance of The Strand.. We checked in on a Sunday and reception was closed with a note saying to ring a number. This went to an answerphone which no one picked up so we were left, after an 8 hour journey, standing outside with no idea what to do.Eventually a passer-by told us that others that day had also been left waiting but they knew someone lived in room 611 which we found (even though it was not numbered) and got in. Our water heater broke on the first day and we were left without hot water for 5 days ! No water for washing or showering or cleaning. Eventually we complained so much they gave us a different apartment. This 'couldn't care less' attitude pervaded the whole place.We had four lights in the bedroom.Only 1 worked. The furniture was shoddy and falling apart and when we left, there was no one around to check us out. The receptionist was also a director and when shown our hot water problem she at first ignored it and said we couldn't prove anything ! Later she tried to blame her staff. This is a run-down place that needs an influx of capital and people who are not just in it for the money. If you stay here, you just hope nothing goes wrong but I would really give it a wide berth.",Bad
"This place is a disaster. The worst service I have ever encountered in a Hotel. In my opinion not even 1 star instead of the (mis)represented 4 stars. Most unfriendly and 100% uninterested personnel I have seen in a lifetime. Hospitality and expercience are the essence of the hotel business. That concept is not understood here. I came 10 minutes before the end of breakfast 10:20 AM in the BF room and the waiters snarked at me with angry looks like I was molesting them. I was not allowed inside and they put me outside the building on a small table. There was no real coffee, however waiters tried to convince me it was real coffee but it was some chemical solution with digusting taste and unnatural foam on top. I did not drink it ofcourse. Later I saw one of these Suchard machines opened with powder containers inside. No coffee beans like advertised on the front.  Up in the lobby/bar area I tried for 15 minutes to order a real expresso since there was a real barrista coffee maschine. There was nobody to man the bar while ample waiters are running around. No waiter would listen. They won't even stop while you talk to them simulating they are very busy while the hotel is vitrually empty and they point down with a handsign to the bar/bf area again. The reception said also there is no service and I should go myself downstairs to the bar to get a coffee and bring it back up here. I asked the receptonist how on earth they managed to get 4 stars if you can't even get a coffee in the lobby and have to go fetch it yourself like in a gas station? Personnel here is offended because you ask them something. After I asked the tourist board complaint form, suddenly it became possible to order an expresso in the lobby. This was at 11:05 AM. I put the check on my room. After 10 minutes the waiter comes back to collect the coffee cash, because the account of my room was 'closed' already. However I did not check out yet. This place is a total mess.",Bad

"Very bad experience, to forget.. Very bad experience. Tenerife was overbooked over christmas and they clearly take advantage to set high prices not corresponding to the standards of the hotel. To start with, Booking canceled another booking I had 'for invalid card' without explanation, althought I haven't had any other truoble with the card. My worst experieince with Booking ever. As for the hotel, difficult to understand good comments, maybe coming from europeans wo payed less than I did, and who are used to very high hotel prices in their countries. For people used to normal spanish standards this hotel really doesn't do it! The room faced a very narrow patio with no natural light at all (You couln't see the sky. The bed sheets didn't cover the matress, the bath was broken and very small. I payed 85 euros the night. The solution of the very aggressive receptionist was that I should cancel and go away with my little child. She even told me off for giving her a hard time on new year!! fortunately she later changed her attitude (probably talked to the manager) and found another nearby much better hotel for us, took off 10 euros of the night, and granted us with the horrible breakfast we had in a dark and sad dinning room. In addition: very hard to park around, no restaurant at the hotel, notdinners... in summary, to forget as I wished, only that I thought I should tell our expirience.",Bad

"Very disappointing!. Attitude of the staff in reception (we were 3 persons). We had to ask for the 3rd plastic chair 3 days until it was brought. This extra bed for the third person was really a hard experience, because it was totally rundown. After every cleaning, only one towel every time was left and again we needed to communicate with reception, but it didn't help The apartment was very humid and therefore all sheets and blankets, too, and it has damaged also wardrobe...the smell inside of it was enormous, we kept our luggage outside of it. If you want to use a kitchen, please, bring knives and forks in your luggage. 3 evenings we asked in reception to provide us knife, every time they promised, but on the 3rd day they said that they haven t in the stock. Big cockroaches are an additional bonus in your apartment. Probably somebody has a better experience. Don't buy excursions from hotel, they are expensive. Near the beach the prices are MUCH cheaper and the service is the same. We have had experienced it. Moreover, they didn't gave me back my scarf i left in the bus....receptionist just said...it's gone, but i asked 5 days non-stop! :-(",Bad

Entertainment is absolutely shocking, good job you can walk or hop in a taxi for 3 euros to take you into the centre.
Overall not worth the money that we paid, will never return to this hotel, been going to Gran Canaria for 15 years, there are much nicer and cheaper places to stay, with excellent service.
Food was awful, and bar staff were rude.
Eve when we complained, they kept saying the manager isn't here, shocking service, and the drinks are measured and very expensive. Nowhere else in Puerto Rico do they measure your drinks... avoid their cocktails, not nice !!!",Bad
"We rented this apartment with two young children.. Really not a nice stay. We had a cockroach in the bathroom. The garden around the building is simply a toilet for 4 dogs and 6 cats, that are running freely around - owned by people living in permanently. Loads of poo and smell of urine. Our apartment was on the ground floor and the animals' hairs were everywhere and were also coming to our room. The biggest surprise was a biggg RAT, sitting on our door frame. I was lucky to have the door closed and he was chased by cat and climbed up there. I have a nice photo on my phone. The place was clean but is very old and I couldn't use any of the wardrobes because of the unpleasant smell. I reported animals (rat and others) problem to the owner but I got no reply. Most of the apartments were rented to young seasonal workers and it was noisy. Some of them were parting till late. Nobody is cleaning around. Loads of broken glasses on the floor. One cat was sleeping on the dining table outside that we were using. Very dirty. Completely not suitable for children. Do not recommend.",Bad

"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Apartments are tired, floor tiles are loose, walls need painting and bathroom needs work. There were ants all over kitchen and bath. Staff tried to get rid of them but it did not work. We were told by reception that it is normal for Tenerife to have ants !   Have been there two times previous to this trip and never had this problem and would not expect to have to deal with this at a 4 star hotel.  We were moved to another apartment but the problem was even worse there. We did not use the kitchen to eat because of this and even had to put toothbrushes in a sealable plastic bag so we would not have ants on them.  The garden looks lovely on the pictures we looked at when we booked the hotel. It was a big disappointment... cosy yes but very small and hard to get a sun bed unless you wake up really early to go and reserve them. There is also a lot of shade in the garden as it is so small and has houses and trees all around.   Over all this hotel was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and we will not be recommending it to anyone.",Bad
A hotel that needs TLC. Miserable straff - and a hotel that has seen better days - a long time ago,Bad
"A roof t sleep under - not much more. Free wifi only in the lobby, aid in the room. Feels like 2005.
Hard metal spring beds,
Next to the Autobahn
Full of white trash ppl.",Bad
"A TRIP INTO THE 80's. The first room we were given was very very scruffy old and wasn't cleaned properly lots of dead cockroaches around felt so cold and dirty! 
So I went and asked to be changed the second room was a tad better so I took it but still was so cold I asked for heater and recieved some really really old army blankets in there place so scruffy and tatty so I couldn't use them! I had to go out and buy jumpers to sleep in! To keep warm! Also the room felt very damp there were lots of cats walking down corridors sleeping on my patio which was also bad as I couldn't go out there as I am highly allergic! U could hear them screaming and crying all night!!",Bad
"A vasted vacation. No  
A/C room. Terribmly hot",Bad
"Absolutely nothing about the hotel although people who work.... It is different building, not as shown on picture. Rooms are small and very dark. Sticky dirty place. Baby cot was disgusting, probably 30 years old, I had to put blankets under mattress to make it possible to use. Noises till midnight.. by noises I mean fake Elvis, Tom Jones etc.. plus drank karaoke singers and picking rubbish at 5-6am from all hotels just under your window. We lost 5 days of holidays :( nightmare.",Bad
"Absolutely Terrible. Was extremely dated all mis matching furniture, tiles in bathroom dirty. Pictures on website not what we got. No patio doors to let fresh air in. Grid/bars on window. The worst apartment I have ever stayed in and I've travelled all over Europe for over 25 years. Didn't give us a minute after 11 am to vacate apartment. Pest spray in kitchen to kill off all the cockroaches.",Bad
Adequate. The person on Reception was very unfriendly.,Bad
"apartment was dated 
. apartment was dated 
no sun beds on balcony
wifi only available by pool
no gym although it was listed as a facility 
view was good if you strained your neck
pictures were of sister complex called regency and not paradise court where we stayed
wont be going back",Bad
"Appalling. The apartment seemed to be privately owned, with the owner removing just their clothes and toiletries, food left in the cupboards, clutter everywhere and not clean. Long dark hairs in the bed!
A girl who spoke no English met us in the street, showed us up and left. We had no one to complain to or ask for clean sheets etc, and it is not serviced.
The name 'Notre apartment' is wrong, it is located in a residential block called Iguaza 2.
There was a fire in the building and we were evacuated in the early morning of 16/01/2017 the smoke detectors didnt work, the electric  fire doors remained open, no alarm was sounded, and the block was full of smoke. Appalling safety measures in a block of 40 apartments
Definitely the worst place I have ever stayed through booking.com  ",Bad
"At most 2+ star hotel. The photos on the internet are far from real. The rooms are small and the whole hotel is very old. They just made a fresh paint and they thought it is enough to be a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was also quite of a low quality and the whole breakfast area wasn't that clean. The sound proof is very poor. The windows are of old wood and you can hear everything from outside. Me and my girlfriend did a tour of the island and we've stood only in 4 star hotels but this hotel was a lie. As a person who traveled and been to all kind of hotels, I believe this one is at most 2+ stars.",Bad
"Avoid at any cost. No hot water 
Very unclean 
Very dated",Bad
"Avoid if at all possible. Breakfast was abysmal, my room was a tiny hole with questionable cleanliness. At this day and age when people have all kinds of electronic gadgets there was only 1 working plug. The wifi was practically non-existent inside the room.",Bad
"Avoid if you can. We didn't like the silver fish in the bed, the cockroaches in the sitting area and the 72 out of control school pupils between 15 and 17/18 from mainland Spain running loose in the corridors and hallways screaming, shouting, running, jumping about at 1.00am.  The hotel reception staff's attitude to the problem and the 4 teachers telling us they could not control their students.  This included letting young girls run through public areas in T shirts and knickers with older boys in hot pursuit at 12.30am.  We understand these students are there until the end of the week, the teacher told us the hotel knew what to expect, so we assume they have school parties on a regular basis.  We also had a broken lock on the patio doors so the door was secured with a chain.  We appreciate some will say still good value for money, but nothing can pay for a sleepless night ahead of our journey home, and I pity the other guests who had the same problem and who were not going home.",Bad
"Avoid if you want a good nights's sleep.. I am surprised that this Hotel has scored so highly.  I think its pretty mediocre and perhaps its score is reflective of the poor baseline quality of accommodation generally in Playa del Ingles.  You need to think very carefully of staying at this hotel in February/March when its carnival.    There is a rave party held in a car park fifteen metres away from the hotel during carnival.  During my eight night stay this rave happened four times from 10.30am until 5am making sleep impossible.  With all the windows closed my phone registered 100db - that's like being 200 metres from a 747 taking off.  No sleep until 5am for four nights.  So unless you know you can sleep easily or will be out until 5am every night I would avoid this hotel. 
I raised this with the hotel. They implied that I should have known it was carnival or what should I expect.  The hotel nor booking.com  does not warn you about carnival and the rave next to the hotel so I am doing this.",Bad
Awful. Everything,Bad
Awful down dungeon rooms like prison. All of it,Bad
"Awful place to stay. No socket in the room. One staff was stupid and can't communicate in English. No new towels. Can't clean room, but very clean toilet",Bad
"Awful would never stay there again. We were not warned about the amount of steps 
The apartment was really shabby 
The beds were horrendous had to sleep on the sofa 3 nights 
Could not open bedroom curtains as people were walking past right outside",Bad
"Awful, would never stay there again under any circumstances. We paid for a large bed and had two beds pushed together, there was no hot water to the room on arrival, and it was suggested that we use another room on another floor to have a shower, a member of the dining room staff was very rude and aggressive towards my Polish partner which upset her, and she was verbally abused by a German guest the following day. The buffet food was apalling quality and you are given a 1 hour time slot for the evening meal. It was so bad that we booked out the following morning, made a formal complaint and moved to another hotel which thankfully was fabulous. We both travel a lot globally and are used to fitting in with local trends and differing levels of hospitality according to the geography or terrain including camping, but when you pay for a certain standard then that is what you expect.",Bad
Awfully hot rooms with no air flow or airconditioning. The rooms are like saunas no air flow through them and only noisy fans. The staff were rude and unhelpful. We had a sofa bed to sit on and watch TV but from Day 1 the cushions were wet and smelt as if someone had wet it or been sick on it. Left the cushions outside and sat on pillows to watch 2 English news channels!,Bad
Bad. nan,Bad
"bad choice. poor Internet connection, very basic and poor breakfast, a lot of small extra taxes (for calling a taxi, etc.), no light in the parking, wind blowing under the doors",Bad
"Bad time with violent reception staff. Poor reception services. 
1) I have never seen people so rude working in a reception. People can't talk to client this ways. My husband was asked in a violent way why he was there, and then he was told he couldn't walk around. I wonder if staff is racist and homophobic. Reception staff refused to say his name as I was asking him to stop, he was afraid I would complain about dunasol. What made things worse is that dunasol management denied everything and didn't apologize for what happened. We spend four days feeling bad, unwelcomed and fearing another verbal assault. I wrote a complaint to Booking.
2) you don't get any information on reception opening hours, so you can expect waiting for a lot of time in front of the closed door reception. Sometimes it is closed even during opening hours.",Bad
Basic book good value. No balcony,Bad
"Basic, old fashioned, disapointed.. Clean enough for bed and bathroom while out all day at beach. 
Self catering - but NO microwave???
Basic, old fashioned, disappointed.",Bad
"Be aware!. Stuff working in restaurant and reception, extremly rude. More important was chat with colleagues rather than service customers. Food was aweful, I got poisoned and ended up at the doctor`s with high temperture. It is not a problem it was simple, it was just horrible - no butter to spread just margarine, all various hams were just fake, the cheapest you can buy. One kind of cheese. For dinner very watery soups with no taste. They just try to save on everything which I find rude.
Being on all inclusive felt wierd to ask for a drink!!! Ordered drinks (were group of 3) differed. One glass half empty, the other w/o ice, the last with barely alcohol in it. Empoyee knew what was doing, turned around and left. We stopped asking for drinks got ours own alcohol and beverages. Never had such situation in my life and visit Gran Canaria for around 10 years!
But that is nothing - witnessed when around 4 year old child being on half board asked for a glass of water - was told off - that needs to pay - am asking is it so difficult to pass some water to a child?
Exchanged emails before arrival and was promissed bungalow with the sea view, when arrived was told there are no such available as they are fully booked. One of the reasons I booked was the view!
Very far from the sea - the bus going to the beach but only 4 times a day, 9.20-12.20, the last return from Maspalomas beach is around 16.30. This is not enough.
Flies everywhere in restaurant - no lamp killing insects, think it is very important.
Safe, even if you do not use it - you will be asked to pay for it - do not get framed - if you do not use something just do not pay for it.
Matresses should be exchanged - if someone is sensible about their back may really suffer.
NO guests allowed - I do not understand why friends of mine who I know for years could not come and meet me during the day or sit and chat around the pool. Place like jail?
My worst stay in Gran Canaria ever with this place.",Bad
Below average. Every thing else !,Bad
"Beware advert wording!!!!. Advertised as villa with hot tub but was 2 bed upper floor apartment with jacuzzi bath which didn't work fully.  Lights didn't work in one bedroom and no fans or aircon throughout and note to say keep windows closed at night due to possible burglars.  Construction work next door with drilling everyday starting 9am.  Requested double bed but got 2 singles in main bedroom which were hard and uncomfortable.  Wifi was advertised as available but advised by owner that it wasn't.
Overpriced for apartment that needed updating and felt owner not really interested in problems.",Bad
"Beware if you are planning to book here.
. I have never stayed in such an insect infested hole in the ground in
all my life. There are obviously good appartments available looking at
the review score but we were put iN casa blanca flat 4. It was a
subteranian hades. There was no view at all , the appartment was
extremely tired but the worst was the mosquitos which fed off you
during the night leaving huge welts on your skin and causing maddening
itching, they were impervious to any form of deterant. We dreaded
returning on an evening. Beware.

"Big disappointment. - it is in the street corner so the noise from the cars is permanently, forget about sleeping long in the morning;
- the WiFi is very bad, at the begining it didn't work at all, then after five days of calling to the office they fix it but it was working only close to the pool, but not inside the building,
- there is no reception desk, You have to remember the code to the box etc., but somehow I didn't receive the e-mail about that;
- the bathroom is very small and in a very bad condition,
- the pool is small and there are some leafs in the water and nobody clean it",Bad
"Biggest complain !. Very Bad apartment condition, 
Terrible room service: first cleaning after 5 days,towels, toilet rolls  weren't replaced.
No free deck chairs even though there's no people around! Within 8 days me and my family weren't able to use any of them. Security and hotel service didn't even try to solve the problem after lots of complains.
Biggest pain with swimming pool tiles or I should say there is no tiles which is impossible to walk !!!! 
I will never recommend this place to any one!!!
Such a waste of money !!!!!!",Bad
"Book somewhere else!. Place was run down, in need of modernising. Nothing really there, uncomfy beds, tiny kitchen, you have to pay extra for everything like a fan, safe, washing etc. Wasn't impressed at all",Bad
"Buenavista staff totally unhelpful!!!. Apartment was ok, clean enough ... staff not helpful .... wouldn't even let us check in after 4 as reception was closed but we didn't land until 4.45! Luckily we had relatives that could collect key or we would've had to cancel and lose flight £ as there was no other apartments available except Ones costing 5 x the amount!!!
Room wasn't cleaned until our last day and they did not give us anymore toilet roll even though there was only 1/4 roll left ! For a family of four with two kids this was ridiculous!!! Two single beds for family of four .... not a comfortable holiday! Room was very dated! It was fairly cheap tho so I suppose I get what u pay for! The shower head if turned on too high flew out its holder and nearly knocked me out, not ideal for kids! Wouldn't like to hav an emergency in these apartments as they are totally unmanned for 4pm until 10am the following morning ! God forbid anyone where to lose their key as the emergency phone number is on the inside of the locked gate!  Also no clean towels until last day which were replaced with hand towels !!!",Bad
"Bugs for your bucks. Garage with old furniture. Smelly old towels and bed bugs, still feel itchy. Worst experience ever! Spend your money elsewhere!!",Bad
"Cheap but crappy. This is quite easy: you get what you pay for! There is no point in complaining about standard etc at this price. However: its's not very difficult to clean a room. The only clean items in the room, was the bed sheets (I think. And hope). 
It's a perfect hostel if you're at a tight budget and don't have hifh expectations",Bad

Food very very samey and not great
Too basic
Too far away",Bad

Very noisy hostel (bring earplugs!), you could hear everything from the corridor and other rooms, extremely dirty bathrooms, no hot water 24/7, rooms were not cleaned during the whole 9 days stay !, staff didn't always speak English, cold rooms (bring extra warm blanket).

It is cold on the mountain.The hostess doesn't speak any English. There are no isolation in the house, it is cold and and draughty. In the house is an ant nest. Ants are everywhere, the only place without ants is the fridge. Internet falls out dayly. The hot water is not really hot, you will have to wait a while before you can shower.
Summary: It is not a place for people with kids or if you intend to go the beach. It is for people who want to be on the mountain and enjoy the view in a winter jacket and a hat.",Bad
"Concrete jungle prison block. The room had a damp smell, light fittings hanging out, no hot water, tiles blown in the bathroom. I paid 120 euros per night. What a rip off. When I complained they just smiled and said there nothing they can do. It was a 1960's concrete jungle.",Bad

Breakfast was noisy crowded and would you believe in Tenerife they ran out of bananas.
The bedroom had a lovely big sun terrace but no sun beds on it.
The noise from the PA system round the pool is deafening.",Bad
"Did not enjoy my stay there at all the room smelled of smoke,suposed to be a no smoking room??. I booked the Bonanza Palace but was put in the Canarife Palace which is not what I wanted.

"Dirty apartment, infested, poor furnishings!. The apartment had not been cleaned - it was dirty!!!  It was also infested with mini ants which crawled all surfaces! I had to clean long black hair out of the drawers before we could put clothes in and sweep the floor of dirt and hair.  There was dust on the kitchenware and on the bath.
The furniture was extremely basic - 2 twin single beds in the bedroom, not the most comfortable with one of the beds continually squeaking.  The sofa bed in the lounge was hard and small suitable for only 2 small children (mine were teenagers).  There were no pillows other than those on the sofa which were like concrete.  I had to borrow some from a friends apartment.  The lounge was also very light so difficult to have a lie in.",Bad

Housing on the 2nd floor without elevator in inner courtyard.Parking too small, often complete.In the evening, karaoke in neighboring hotel!
Internet: null, every connection must be reintroduced a code with numbers and letters, even if we suspend a few minutes.
The morning of the departure water cut: impossible to take a shower!
EQUIPMENT :
No microwave-Beds: 2x 1 single bed -Bathroom: hot water blocked by a mixer at 30 degrees, too cold! -Boiler too small for dishes and shower for two people, boiler of 25 liters!
Oven: there is nothing to take the hot dishes or to place them neither potholders nor flat protector -Sink: the stopper leaks, does not keep the water ...
Dishes: minimum for two people ...",Bad
"Disappointing stay. The hotel has a good location but does not warrant a 3 star status.
Rooms are very dated and there seems to be a lack of understanding as to what a customer requires in 2017.
The bathroom was distgusting, mould on grouting, tiles were painted to make them look like new ????? Photos available !!
The hotel staff are obviously working on a fine budget and work hard.
But there did not seem to be anyone ""managing "" the hotel at all.
Great pity as it could be much better",Bad
Disaster from the start. No aircon in any room. Rooms not suitable for family's. Staff didn't speak great English. All inclusive finishes at 10.30 not worth it. Food was always cold.,Bad
Disgusted. The staff were not helpful at all I paid for 3 nights and only stayed for 1 night I was in tears at one point only to have a door shut in my face,Bad
Disgusted at treatment and no management available to us until Monday.. First apartment was unclean and we refused it. Alternative was fine for first 4 hours and then told we had to move because another customer requested it. Complex turned off our water when we declined move offer. We moved under duress and the apt moved another couple into it on the same evening.,Bad

dissaster... explained in the latter.,Bad
"Do not ""be-live"" a single word!. - Long queues for check-in, it took almost 50 minutes.
- All-inclusive concept is deceitful, they charge money for almost everything. 
- Spa is not included ""all inclusive"" concept, so photos here are deceitful. They only provide one-time entrance, and the indoor spa pool and the Jacuzzi is far from being warm.
- Food was really low in quality. Breads are stale. 
- They even charge extra money for weigh for luggage.
- There is only free wi-fi literally next to the reception desk and the signal is extremely low so there is no wi-fi in the restaurant, lobby or in the rooms. However if you want to pay extra more for wi-fi although you are staying there ""all-included"" they have another wi-fi network where you can connect anywhere.
- They charge 1 euro for entering the spa for the flip-flops they provide. The amount of money is not a problem, but the thing is if you go to an all-inclusive hotel you don't want to carry coins and money, it ruins the whole experience.",Bad

"DO NOT BOOK HERE. As we first came in to the hotel (Friday 16 September 2016) with very high expectations we got to our room we reserved exactly TWO months ago with a king size bed so I can share with my partner and came to see we got a room with two separate beds and a broken door, we came back to reception and told them that we are not satisfied with the room because we did not reserve this type of bed (with proof) and the reactions were unforgivable to say the least - they took an hour to look for a new room for us without one apology and made us feel as like it was our fault because we reserved our room threw booking.com and claimed they have problems with the website (NOT OUR PROBLEM) and by the end the only solution they gave us at the reception was to upgrade our room and pay more!!- after they made the mistake, we met with the manager after not agreeing to upgrade and the manager of the day did not give us any eye contact or apology but after 15 min he found us a room. About the room itself- The bed was sandy from day one until day six, we had a problem with the fire alarm because of the steam from the shower and yet once again the horrible staff at the reception ordered a technician to come fix the problem the next morning at 11:00am without managing with us as guests when will it be convenient for us but instead we were in the shower and had to yell threw the bathroom to come back in 15 min- ridiculous. The worst staff we've ever met, never coming back!",Bad
"DO NOT ENTER ROOMS 001 and 002!. 1. We booked a suite for 3 people with non-smoking option and requirement of quiet room (travelling with a child). Upon the arrival we were proposed to use room Nr. 001 which looked very good but smelled like a tobacco plant. Seems like generations of smokers lived there. In order to avoid that odour we moved to the next and sole available apartment Nr. 002 which was twice smaller. The toilet seat was broken, the shower always jumped out its holder when you switched the water on and off (finally fixed it with a duct tape). The noise at the room was incredible as it was located right behind the reception and you heard every word and every cry of the babies or youngsters passing by. However after 3 nights the staff moved us to other room 103 which was rather good and comfortable. They were really sorry for that experience but could do nothing as the hotel was fully booked.
2. The cleanliness needs improvement. you will find lot of dust and hairs under the the beds and the bed clothes (especially for the third optional bed) had some yellow stains.
3. You are required to pay in advance and to write down credit card details in a special form (save the PIN and CVC) for the reason ""If you brake something in the room"". Looks very suspicious and unpleasant. Hope the staff used that option to claim damages from smokers who poisoned room 001.
4. TV sets are built into the furniture, so you have no chance to connect anything to the TV.",Bad

Dont waste your time and money. First of all u r welcomed by the smell of urine on the entrance (due to the nasty cats people feed ) The swimming pools are nasty under neath the water shouldnt really be called a water its chloride solution that u r supposed to swim in. Everything is outdated not just in the apartments but in maspalomas its a post nuclear outcome all over the place. Just to clarify I booked the so called 'superior flat' . The flat hasne been cleaned or repaired since they first built it probably 10 years ago. The walls are nasty and need repaining. The doors are broken and need replacing. The shower is beyond disgusting. There are spider nets all over the place and Im sure this place have never been cleaned properly. And btw they never cleaned the flat during my stay and there is no mop or what so ever . The beds are uncomfortable and even tho Im not picky I was forced to turn the matress over (hoping it will get any better) or sleep on thr sofa . The pillow and towels are from pre historic era cant even describe how uncomfortable they are. And dont think that self catering is good idea in such apartments because there is no oven and small hobs the frying pan is a joke so tiny that it looks like a toy. For the money I paid I could've gotten cleaner and better place.,Bad

"Greedy hotel. Hotel is very greedy. I booked room with half board. Half board by definition means breakfast and dinner. But they charged extra for water or juice in dinner. So called free WiFi - costed 10 eur / day. So called free parking costed 10 eur/day. And the towels was very used. It's not that I cannot pay for these services, it's hidden and not previously agreed  costs that makes overall experience in this hotel very bad.",Bad
"Grottsville.     Not a place we would return to ever. Entrance to apartment strewn with rubbish still there 8 hours after reporting it.  Stained pillow,no pillowcase. This was rectified.

Unbearably hot even late at night, so spent much of the night outside on the patio as unable to sleep. The fans were totally inadequate.

"Horror!!! Terrible!!!!ужасно!. 1. There was a very wet room, without adecuate wind sweeten, but((( we had a lot of flys in bath and bedroom
2. I had to ask cleaning lady to clear our room, and the terriblest thing was that one day she ""made"" our room, but left all bed clothes wet and dirty( travelling with small child)",Bad
Huge disappointment!. Almost everything!,Bad
"Huge disappointment.. Booking.com pictures vs reality was far from the truth. Apartment was a huge disappointment and we really felt that we bought something which did not exist at the venue. Apartments no 12 should not be sold with pics, which are presented at booking.com!",Bad
"I cannot recommend that place.. We have been there for 7 nights/days and apartment was cleaned just once. But, 'cleaned' is really too big word, there have only been changed the towels. We bought the internet access but it was not only extremely slow but limited to just one device as well. I definitely do not recommend that place.",Bad
"I enjoyed my whole holiday just been in gran caneras,but.... Staff not accommodating at all, everything a problem .Cleaning staff seem to rule management  which i find most bizarre.Very badly managed .Very expensive for such a poorly run  and shabby complex.I  could go on forever but no point. Wont be staying again.",Bad
"I enjoyed the weather and the guided walks, the golf and the meals out and visiting Caleta.. This is a very tired hotel in a dirty area",Bad
I got a cold bottle of water very fast.. Everything looked poor!,Bad
"I would never stay in it again. We stayed there for 10 days the first night we came home from being out haven food there were thousands of ants all over the kitchen,in my shoes all over our bed, all over our food we only bought that day and we had to trow it all out. The next day we got moved to a different room because we had bites all over our body for the ants so we asked could we move so that was grand we moved to a different one to find a lizard running around that was grand we wore there for another 7 days not once did anyone even try come in and as much as try to change the bins. Then sitting on the balcony one night haven a few drinks we seen a rat playing down at the bins we were terrified to even leave our windows open in the night",Bad
"Iberostar Hotel Anthelia are Robbers. Although I booked (an outrageously expensive) ""room with bath""  they put us in a terrible little hole called a ""modern"" room with no bath, no shelf space for clothes, no table or desk space, automatic flood in bathroom when took shower, no bathroom door-lock or even -catch - so toilet & sitter visible from outside the ""closed"" door!! -& worst of all they refused to change us to a civilised room for 24 hours -despite robbing me of £400 for 24 hours with DBB in that hole!!",Bad
"In fact nothing. I booked and prepaid for 4 apartments in January 2014, which would be used for 14 days in late October / November 2014, ie 10 months later. In our traveling companions there were 4 young children from the youngest one half years to the oldest of three years, specified in the order. In addition, we sent an email to BB where we requested that the apartments were next to each other, and that was why we were early on order.
When we arrived the 18 of oct. the surprise was therefore great when the apartments were far apart. When we a bit frustrated asked why, the response was that they could not arrange it on such short notice ?? 10 months !! After a discussion, we got three apartments close to each other, but all four apartments were far away as possible from the pool / reception / output. The elevator took us to the level 2 and from there we had to take us to plan 5 where our apartments were. With four young children in strollers, there was a trial of strength to go in several long stairways.
2 of the apartments were in poor condition, with broken refrigerator, loosely toilet, errors with oven and ceiling fans did not work. The patio in the same two apartments were very limited and not very child friendly because of large trees and shrubs, which also hindered visibility.
The service level of the staff in the pool bar, restaurant and reception was not very customer friendly.
Bought 3 weeks WIFI connection for 5 concurrent users, but it worked poorly. When I contacted the front desk, they apologized only.  I took direct contact with the supplier, and the revealed errors at level 5, as the parent, but the net was always very unstable and it was only sometimes it was possible to email or read the newspaper online.
No,  it will be never Bahia Blanca for me and my family. There are better places in Puerto Rico. If there is worse? .. I really do not know.",Bad
"Internet is lousy. This hotel charges 8 euros a day for a slow Internet connection, only one device allowed, and in the reception area only. There is no wifi at all in the apartments.",Bad
"It was okay. But not very good for children.. We had half pension. We were shocked to hear that no drinks (not even water) was included in the dinner. We should pay cash for the drinks, every time we ate dinner and it was not possible put the bill on the room. The dinner was SI and so. We did not see any remote control for TV or AC. Not enough soap, towel or clean sheets....",Bad
"its quite cheap, really near yumbo and nothing else good. super old apartment, not clean, they dont wash the dishes, cleaners not polite at all, uncomfortable mattress, shower lacking water and really small, so many apartments from local people in the building so could be really crowd as they are used to fit the whole family and friends in those small apartments (specially weekends), even if reception tries to control it with a wrist band for tourist ppl (but not working) and they still invading the common areas. the receptionist wasnt the clever guy ever (wrong info, wrong paper work, difficulty while paying separately , even if it was in his own language) the woman receptionist had to fix everything later, she was nice.",Bad
Laguna Park 2 hell hole . Cleanliness was terrible ants cochroaches and Bedbugs in apartment never stay here again came. Home on early flight ,Bad
"Laguna Park One..... Never again !!!. The cleaners didn't clean !! The kitchen was invaded by huge cockroaches, there was plaster coming off the wall, the pull out double sofa bed that was described in the apartment itinerary was in fact just an old sofa & not a sofa bed and could only sleep one person,  and had an old single camp bed in the corner of the lounge. the patio door lock kept getting stuck. the apartment was filthy, the bathroom door was not only suffering from unsightly wood rot but also had a brocken door lock, it would lock but wouldn't unlock leaving my partner trapped in the bathroom. we went down to reception to speak to them about the issue's, their response was ""sorry but all the apartments are the same""... Overall very disappointed, never again !!!",Bad

"Location great apartment not so good. Was charged 30 euros for cleaning although it was previously included in the overall price the apartment was swarmed with ants and dead cockroaches scattered around!! Towels had a bad smell had to request an iron, hairdryer didn't work neither did some rings on the hob!! I was also charged an extra 14 euros for internet but had to use my own data as internet was worse than useless",Bad
"Location to beach pretty good, pool looked nice and roof top.... Lack of cleanliness and very poor quality.
Pillow cases too small for pillows and ends stuck out.
Beds hard and foldaway.
Settee extremely hard and unusable.
Bins only emptied once during our stay.
Electrical wires exposed and plug sockets hanging off wall- very dangerous.
Routine maintenance occurring to bathroom while we were in the room!! This left a lingering smell of mastic in the air for some time.
Bathroom floor flooded each time one took a shower.
The spiral staircase to the roof terrace had no guard rail and a lattice board at the end through which no pressure should be put on, an accident waiting to happen!
Breakfast- not pleasant.Very poor quality and cold.
The 80 steps to our room around many bends and alleyways. No mention of difficult access anywhere! To be avoided if you have mobility issues or lots of luggage.
Pool not heated and not a soul in it as it was too cold.
Definately not value for money or worth the money paid to stay here.
I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone, the dangerous electrics, access issues and lack of cleanliness/quality were the main factors.",Bad
"Location was excellent. No courtesy room
Had to get up early to reserve sun beds
Partial sea view room overlooked bins
No courtesy room on check out and very dirty showers in the gym (and only one of the two was working)",Bad
"Location was great.. Overpriced for the facilities, we were told it would be a see view it wasn't. There was no air conditioning, it was fans that barely worked meaning the apartment was hotter than outside.  They did work in the room on the first day, didn't tell us and then left bits on the bed and floor which we nearly tripped over.  There was no wifi which as I had to work was a nightmare.  I book with booking.com a lot and have usually been happy but this will probably prevent me from doing so again.",Bad
"Location.. Cockroaches everywhere; in the kitchen, in the bed, in bathroom, even in the luggages inside the clothes. Impossible to use the kitchen. Very old hotel, terrible beds. Definitely a bad choice, would never stay there again.",Bad
"Location.. Below our expectations. Dirty, smelly, bathroom mouldy, no blankets, no clean sheets every day... this pretty much spoilt our holidays.",Bad
"Look for another hotel to have a good vacation.
. The hotel is not as described. Only 20% of all rooms has any view. The
staff is not worrying about your requests. I left after only few days
being there but still can not get the refund for prepaid and not used
days. For me it looks like fraud. Stay away from this place.
",Bad
"Loved Maspalomas. The apartment was extremely poor for the price of a self catering. No kettle, toaster or oven. Just two rings of a hob on the worktop. When we asked for a kettle and toaster the management were very rude. Sand over the surfaces of most things in the living area missed by the cleaner coming in every day.",Bad
"Lovely swimming pool clean in and around the pool
. Staff attitude very poor and unhelpful location in the middle of nowhere
so have to take a taxi everytime you go out and the hotel charge you to
call for a taxi, then the taxi driver charges you for a call out charge,
some also charge to put a pram In the boot, then they add an addition
surcharge for I don't know what! The room was damp, windows wet
every morning cockroach in the bathroom cleanliness of apartment was
very poor beds were the worst I have slept in every night when we got
into bed it felt damp as the room was damp
",Bad
"Lovely View, but cleanliness was horrible. Room was cleaned once out of the 4 days we stayed there ! Food is not convenient for vegetarians, i had a half board and all i could eat was bread and some salad. There is no signs to say what food has meat, so i had to guess and check the food most of the time.",Bad
"Many restrictions, no seaview,  unpleasant stay.. We spend a week in the hotel. Impression was not good because of the way how the hotel is managed. We paied for partial seaview, but had no seaview. Hotel was not able to make a reservation of the 2 rooms next to each other even I called and asked for it ahead. We spent long time by waiting for everything, entrance to dinning room, clean beach towels, sport equipment - table tenis racket, towels in gym, check-in.....etc.  Everything was complicated. At the entrance of the dining hall was a cue due to admin worker filling some paper work for each guest every time. One family in front of us waiting 20 minutes with the daughter on crutches has been required to go back due to not compliance with the dress code. Inside pool is empty because children below 12 are not allowed to enter despite the water in outside pool was too cold for kids to play in. Also inside pool is open only from 10 a.m till 5 p.m. Gym is also not allowed for the kids under age of 15. When I ordered a bicycle at the reception the supplier required me to keep it in the room. When I reluctantly accepted the hotel management asked me to sign the paper making me responsible for health and safety of the staff. Whatever you ask for you are requested to wait for customer relations manger to come and tell you that you will not get it.
Poor cleaning service.",Bad
"MASARU APARTAMENTOS DID NOT MEET THE ON LINE CRITERIA WHICH WE EXPECTED.. Staff attitudes, rooms not satisfactory, many guests were German and the hotel had no control over poor poolside behaviour.
Wifi connections were difficult.",Bad
"Maspalomas beach was nice!. The Koala Garden Suites is not as nice as would appear on the pictures.  The decor is out-dated the bathroom is falling apart and we found hair in the shower that did not belong to us.  
There is a reason they don't show the kitchen you have available in your room in the glossy picture because it's in a cupboard and it's very limited. I don't know how this hotel has a seemingly audacious rating of 7.1 on booking.com The simple stuff you would expect in your room like a hairdryer or a TV remote you have to pay extra or put down a deposit. TV remote, really? 
Oh, I had to spend 30 minutes lying to my girlfriend that it was beetle not a cockroach that ran through our living room one evening when we were watching TV, (it was a cockroach)",Bad
"never again. The apartment was in need of an upgrade ,it was sparse, the bare minimum of utensils and the furniture was outdated.The senior reception staff was a very grumpy man. The pool was not very clean, the sun beds were  tatty, rusty and mattresses ,which also were not very clean ,had to be collected and returned to a lock up after use.",Bad
"Never again!!!. Reception and bar do not exist. They are there but constantly closed and there is no information when they are open. To check in you need to call for staff and wait 30 minutes even if you did provide time of arrival.
Reception staff incredible rude!!! We got party in the pool next door and couldn't sleep after whole day trip. We called around midnight to request to change the room. Person arrived after half an hour and asked me what I want as he was driving for 30 minutes... Few rooms where provided but either still to close to party pool or to other rooms where was party too. When I asked the guy why he is not doing anything with it as there is night silence after 23, he told me to go back home if I do not like it!!!!! When I requested refund and wanted to change the hotel finally I got quiet room. This kind of person should not work in the hospitality as it is shame for this island. As reception was closed all the time I was not able to speak with manager directly.",Bad
"Never stay again. The property was dirty sheets had stains the staff were rude and facilities they say they provide they don't, staff won't help when you have a problem and would never stay here again.",Bad
"New years eve buffet was nice. Before we came. The pictures of the Hotel were beautiful. The place, when we arrived, were not!
Missing lights, a cat in the room, alive insects in the room, bad beds, broken coffee maschine, room dirty, had to ask for to change the beds.",Bad

"Nice complex , but very poor outdated room. No air conditioning, bedroom was swimming with rainfall coming under door , suitcases got soaked as we had them packed and ready to leave the night before, my wife slipped in puddles getting up for bathroom in the night, paid for wi-if which didn't work in our room or on terrace, poor service changing towels every 5 days which were threadbare & very small, one toilet roll to last 5 days, management were clueless, speaking to other guests who paid same price had maid service every day and some 3days,they also had more updated rooms with air con, I'm was so disappointed in what we had to live in",Bad

No assistance up the hills. Furniture beds etc,Bad
"non refurbished room in poor condition and noise throughout the stay. Massive roadworks outside the front of the building made unbearable noise from early morning for the whole trip. The clubs are so close at the back also that noise every night is until at least 3am. The rooms and floors not renovated (mine was not) are in terrible condition nothing nothing the photos, my room had a smashed window with glass protruding inwards, it had plaster filled halls in every door and cupboard door, a wardrobe with 6 hangers and a shelf over 6 feet up that was untraceable to store things in, entrance door had to be slammed to close it where it had clearly previously been broken through and the frame was broken, there was no tea and coffee maker as described, light fittings were smashed and hanging from the wall in the bedroom, there were lose cables causing trip hazards on balancing and living area, the kitchen surface was actually snapped and hanging down, some rooms had security bars across Windows mine didn't and finally there was lift where the door does not fully close as it moves. I will be Pershing a complaint and sending the rest of the photos.",Bad
Not a good stay. We requested a double/king bed and was offered a twin bed which eventually got stuck together to make a double bed after 3 follow up calls (over an hour). The excuse given was too many arrivals and couldn't cater for our needs in time.,Bad
Not a great experience.. Apartment was ground floor. Was a disgrace. No balcony or no view. Appeared to be a garage converted badly. Man in the reception was pure ignorant and everything was bother to him.,Bad
"Not as it seems!. The apartment was very basic for 5 people.  5 small teacups, 5 dinner plates, 5 bowls, 5 tumblers, a frying pan and 2 saucepans.  1 wine glass and that's it.  No bowls or serving dishes, very limited, just about managed to make a slice of toast. Towels were changed once, and we were supplied with clean bedding mid week, but were left to strip the beds and make them ourselves.  No-one collected the dirty linen.  There was a table & 4 chairs, and an old plastic chair outside the apartment with a broken clothes airer.  No balcony at all and no views.  Photos show balcony at front apartments but ours was at the back up the concrete stops, backing onto a hotel.",Bad
"Not as let to believe on booking.. State of repair and decoration
Power sockets hanging off wall
Balcony door did not lock
Did not get high up floor as requested
No wi fit in rooms",Bad
"Not clean, not friendly.. On check in at 22.30 (10.30pm) room not cleaned and no other room could be given to us as front desk had no authority to change things. Not helpful
At all. No air conditioning, no fans at reception so we had to buy one as the rooms were extremely stuffy and warm. pool only cleaned once per week on Tuesday. Apartment  cleaned twice in seven days. You could not get a brush to sweep the floor in between cleaning days. Bins at the pool not emptied regularly, overflowing for days creating a lot of flies. Overall I would never go back to the apartments again and would definately not recommend them the only plus is location. We had other family staying there and their rooms were in major need of refurbishment.",Bad
"Not clean. Left after 2 nights.. standard of cleanliness, bedding and towels.
Cupboards and drawers contained owners property.
Hopefully improved following our discussions with the agent.",Bad
"Not for young children.. Everything else. Location, hotel, room, food, etc....",Bad
"Not good. Unfortunately, the bunglalow we were allocated was roadside, it was noisy and the room was very cold!
Cleanliness. Strong smell of cigarettes
in bungalow.
The light key being attached to the door
key.
We saw five cockroaches in the room!!!!",Bad
"Not good place.. Not clean. The service is very bad. I had two reservations and I wasn't in hotel when mu friends arrive and the recepcionist told to may friends ""If You won't leave, I will call to the police"". This is not very good answer to the family. 
Very gold floors. Durty blakents. We foud some cockroaches. 
Very hard beds. The kids were sleeping on the open coach, which were broken.",Bad
"Not great..... The reception staff were awful.
There were ants in our first room.
Never a manager on duty.
We had to change room twice.
When we arrived they tried to tell us we had booked a studio apartment when we had booked a one bedroomed apartment.",Bad
Not impressed. No body met us on arrival took me 1-30 minutes to eventually get the keys the miserable girl on reception did not want to know because in her words not mine WE HAD NOT BOOKED direct with yucca park appalling?im looking forward to your response,Bad
"Not kids friendly hotel. Stuff did not allowd to see apartment in advance. House spartment large, but not friendly fior little kids. No any Wifi internet. You can reach this hotel only by car.",Bad
Not like. Not like,Bad
"Not recommended. The room was in a really bad condition. The smell was strong and disgusting, of the chlorine. The room was poor with 2 beds instead of the fact that I ordered twin. The bathroom was dirty.
The reception employee did not want to change the room when we asked for.
Bigger problem relates to the reception itself - the lady dissapeared for more than 40 minutes during check-out time and we couldn't leave the hotel and travel further.
WIFI - is working only in the common area, downstairs, not in the rooms.",Bad
"Not recommended. Me and my girlfriend arrived about 22:00 after driving one hour from south airport to the hotel.
When we arrived there was not a free space to park the car and the receptionist proposed park on the street outside and far from the hotel.But it was impossible since there were not any spot free.After long search i succed find a space.
When we got in the room we were surprised since my reservation was for a sew view room.
Instead of that i was given a room in the first floor which had view to the parking.The furniture were old and the balcony door was not locking,which means it was easily accessible from the parking.The towels of the bathroom were very old.
When we asked the reception to give us the room type that i have booked they said that hotel was full and if i want a sew view room i had to pay extra.After long fight and arguments they promised to change the room the next day and give me the room type which i have booked.
The hotel is situated in a small hill.To return back to the hotel you must climb 120 stairs something really exhausting after a long day.
The hotel staff spoke poor german and more poor english.
The swimming pool was really cold and the wellness facilities nothing special.
I was expecting something better since the price was quite high.",Bad
"not recommended in tenerife. Accommodation was in need of a major overhaul.
Would not use electrical appliances as grubby and sub standard.
Location very poorly described",Bad
"Not sure how this hotel is rated 7.8 on booking. I'm not sure how it is rated 7.8 on booking
Hotel is too old
Too expensive we paid 100 euros for one night 
Beds were like a block uncomfortable pillows
Everything you need you have to pay for it
Gym is to pay for, wifi is to pay for, the safe is for rent, breakfast is for 9 euros. Free wifi only in the lobby and you can barely book a flight. 
Breakfast staff felt like they were forced to do their job not smiling or welcoming at all.
Definitely not recommending this hotel to anyone.",Bad
Not that impressed. The hills!the staff wasn't very helpful and we only had out apartment cleaned once !,Bad
"Not what I expected. The Judoca Beach Apartments are nicely located only about 3-5 minutes walk from the dunes in Maspalomas and Playa del Inglish. The yard is nice and well maintained, the tiles are hosed daily and the little pool is clean.
They even have a jacuzzi there for those wanting to relax in the evening.
For those more into noise and action, let me recommend the early morning hour starting at 6 o´clock when the bottle recycling container on the street right next to the building is emptied.
I stayed there from 22. December 2016 - 4. January 2017. I had my doubts about the apartment as even though I had booked in May it was the only apartment left in this area for the seasonal holidays. I was travelling with a relative and thus I booked an apartment with twin bed, A/C, free Wi-Fi, some TV channels etc. - just a basic apartment. I really didn't care about those add-ons as I had a rental car and I'm not much for lying in the sun. To me, the apartment was just a home base as we intended to drive around and take-in the culture of Gran Canaria by travelling.
When I arrived there, I was a little surprised about the welcoming committee - a dying cockroach just outside the door to the apartment. I pushed it to the side with my foot and was absolutely not going to let this ruin my holidays. The surprise kept hitting me though when I entered the apartment as an extra bed had been placed in the living room/kitchen area for me to sleep on. I had requested a twin bed, but instead there still was a double bed in the sleeping room plus this military stile bed in the living room. This is not what was advertised nor is it a twin bed according to international standard. Again I took a deep breath and was not going to let this upset my holidays. Not even when I looked around and saw the condition of the apartment - not to mention the dirt. After all, my intention was to use the apartment as a home base for sleeping.",Bad
"Not what we thought it was. No way 5* perhaps 2* at best. Didn't realise it was a predominantly gay hotel, not really our sort of place.",Bad
"Not worth the money. some of the staff here are thoroughly rude and not willing to assist their paying customers. We visited in April and the staff were brilliant, but in September they were very poor. I sent an email to the manger to voice our issues with our stay and it was ignored so we won't be back. Not a massive amount of choice food wise. Apartment was dirty. A lot of people staying here owned timeshare and were very disgruntled by many issues they encountered. Costs about 10 euros to get to las Americas",Bad
"Nothing. Everything about the hotel. Substandard facilities, Rooms without windows, No good ventilation. If you needed a fan, pressing iron or internet facilities, you had to pay. Cleanliness was very poor and there was a smell of fat(oil). No value for money.",Bad
"nothing. Very bad experience would never come there or recommend this place, I am still waiting for a manager to call me back",Bad
nothing. a beach close to the hotel not 300m precluded by a 900m descent first,Bad

Taxi is a big problem. No restaurant and shops near villa. Swimming
pool is cold

"Nothing but the view.. Where do I start. Cats, cockroaches and food poisoning and that was all in the first 24 hrs. This is certainly not a 3 star hotel it's a B&B at best. The structure its self is falling down, the rooms fail at least 5 health and safety issues sockets hanging of walls cockers not sealed the list goes on trust me. We paid half board for the week and had to eat out , the food was cheap over fryed kiddie menus. Had to ask for some of our money back so we could eat outside.",Bad
"Nothing Very poor. This was an apartment bodged up into three bedrooms with shared bathroom.  Just a bed in it, which just about held together. Not even a towel. Bathroom not clean and tap not attached to sink.",Bad
"Nothing worked well. When we arrived we had to wait for our room although it was after 2pm. Our TV only had BBC2 and after 7pm BBC 1 one of our chairs was cracked. It was extremly noisy with a main road and two karaoke bars as well as a night club! We had a bath but had to turn the hot water tank up dangerously high so we could have a shallow bath, the plug did not fit properly either. The wifi was also functioning poorly. We had no water thought the day for 2 days running.",Bad
Oh my god !. Oh my god !! What an old hôtel !!!  The food is disgusting and in 3 days they didnt even change the towels !!!,Bad

"One of my worse stays in Europe so far. Rooms look shabby and are due a refurb (especially carpets. Found a stain on the sheets on arrival, reported but was still there 10 hours later.

"Orlando apartments block 4 and 5 are not for  holidays.. Awful do not go.  On all our bookings paper work the apartment was 305  we were put in 207. there was no one to hand over the keys, several calls later the lady turned up. The apartment was dirty. we bought bleach and cleaning  products and did it our selves. The shower curtain was discoloured and hard with dirt we washed that. The towels chewing gum grey and crispy!  we bought new ones. the bedding was old and ""bobbley"" On the first night  someone was trying to get in with a key,   on our way in  another evening there was another man trying to get in , he ran off  when we shouted at him. The owner did not want to meet us at the apartment on the agreed time the morning of our departure, she made it rather tight for time, however she did come to the out side gate and passed the E150 we  had given in case on breakages  to my husband .

Over priced short staffed outdated decor in rooms and not particularly clean. the first apartment we stayed in had no air conditioning. We had to pay substantially for airconditioing and we got wifi.  However it was meant to be a superior apartment which it wasn't The decor was extremeely poor very outdated.  It took ages for the staff to answer the reception phone. One member of the staff was particularly rude and unhelpful.  The food was the same and we always felt rushed with staff clattering around with their  trollies cleaning up.  I would not recommend this hotel except the location was nice with beautiful views across the bay.,Bad
"Overpriced. furniture dirty, no laundry facilities, no good internet, over priced",Bad
"Overpriced and too noisy. The flat was located at the back of the complex with major building renovations going on behind it. Noise was horrendous from 8am to late and totally spoilt sunbathing. 
Kitchen was totally ill equipped and didn't even have a kettle.
Double the price of similar flats through other operators",Bad

"Overpriced, not 4 stars.. Overpriced! this is not a 4 stars apart-hotel because of the service they give and the food(at least the breakfast). The day we came in the TV was not working, all rooms are single beds (or at least that is what the receptionist told us) and the bed sheets are old and broken a bit discusting, shower temperature doesn't stay constant.",Bad

"Poor. The rooms are very basic. Literally bed, wardrobe and locker. The room is in desperate need of repair. Their was wires hanging from the ceiling. There was questionable marks on the walls. The pillow case had holes in it. The towel had 2 big brown marks but smelt clean. The spare blanket in wardrobe (which I needed) was filthy. There was music from outside until nearly 3am. The doors are very loud so you can hear everyone come and go all night. When the reception closes at night, the buzzer can be heard perfectly from my room which woke me every time someone wanted to get in. 
The toilets were weird. 2 toilets and 2 showers all in the same room so no privacy if you wanted a shower. 
Alright for a night on a budget",Bad

"Poor staff and inadequate facilities!. The staff at poolside and bar inside were terrible. The lifeguard was a joke! More interested in playing up to women, playing on his phone, or sitting around the bar than helping people in the pool. One afternoon a man had to dive in to pull a child drowning out of the pool as the lifeguard did nothing! Also a total lack of sun beds and shade around the pool. Some people even taking to lying on the floor as they couldn't get beds!",Bad

"Price, Always vacancy. Very unfriendly staff, showers on 3rd floor are ok but on the other levels could be reformed, not very clean either",Bad
"Probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!. Unfortunately 2-3 sentences are not enough to mention everything.
If you don't know Spanish, the language barrier between you and the staff is as big as the Great Wall of China. 
The hotel room (107) was fairly clean, but the common area looks really dirty.
The breakfast is only two really hard loaves of bread, some butter, some jam, and a cheese & meat plate. Many people get their own things starting from day 2.
If your room is looking into the street, you won't be able to sleep. The glass and the frame so thin that you think everyone passing through the street is walking next to your bed.
Old, uncomfortable bed and shower with unreliable water temperature.
Oh, and as if none of them were bad enough, the ceiling started leaking at 1 am in the morning! The staff fixed (!) it by putting two towels where the water drops. We listened to the drops until we went to sleep.
And of course, no internet internet in the rooms.
Please pay some more and get a decent place. This is your holiday!",Bad

Riosol looks fine on the pictures, but honestly the hotel is starting to be an old used one and the people whom did the modernization for some years ago wasn't doing it very well, things are already very used and even the kitchen part is done by very cheap materials, cleaning of the room is like winning the lottery for a good or bad cleaning, when we arrived and got the key, the lady doing the cleaning, wasn't there and the room looked like second works war scene, I mean not ready at all. We were offered a drink, very thankful, I would recommend this only outside busy weeks otherwise this hotel is loose of money, furthermore or child got sick in the public area, we were told to do the cleaning our selves after he puked on the floor, thank you and that's a new year, we have never been meet by such friendly ness before, ohh my, I will never use a penny on thus hotel anymore.",Bad
"Rip off in the South with disgusting food. The breakfast was absolutely DISGUSTING. The whole room where it was being served smelled abhorrent.
No information about parking was communicated to us and there were only ~20 spaces available for a huge hotel.
The floor everywhere was tiled and staff wheeled trolleys over the tiles in the middle of the night (past 11pm) making very loud noise - again and again. 
We stayed in the North of Tenerife for less than the cost of this hotel and it was 10 times nicer. Such a rip off.  
Bed really uncomfortable.
Also paid for a room with 'a view'. The 'view' was of a tennis court and the  back of the hotel.",Bad
"Road view with amplified road noise. The room is advertised as Ocean View but should be advertise as Road View with traffic noise. We were in Block 4 don't stay there unless it is free (and even then think about it!) Single glass doors and a balcony acting as a funnel for every car, motorbike and bus going up the hill.

To make it all worst the staff are the rudest bunch I have ever experienced. If you don't have a stone iron tummy then avoid the restaurant at all cost, 1st night we had a baby cockroach crawling across the buffett and 2nd night the ceiling leaked on to our table, when brining it to the staffs attention they laughed.

It is really good, that the hotel provide such special service, but we didn't ask for it...It was very difficult to use the kitchen, bathroom...
One more sad thing, that the general manager of the hotel, Anne Bennett, was fight shy of us, like a child...
So,summorize, this is very unlikely place for holidays & rest, it is some sort of anthill... Everything here is not about the service & quality, I think, that they just offer cheap ""Cava"" to aged people, trying to sell them ""Timeshare""... that is the goal....",Bad

The chatge for the parking is 12 EUR for a day!!!",Bad
We didn't enjoy our stay at all because of many reasons.. We didn't enjoy our stay at all because of many reasons. First of all the staff was not experienced and recuired a lot of paparwork and took our time. 3 of 4 rooms smelled bad and all the rooms were dirty. The Bathrooms were so dirty that we couldn't shower and it's the main reason for why we won't come back or recommend Isla Bonita to anyone.,Bad
"We were very disappointed and will definetly not be returning.. Where do I start.... No locks on the patio doors, which lead out on to a roof top terrace.  This is not safe especially with small children.  Lots of ants and cockroaches everywhere and broken equipment in the kitchen.  No English channels on the small TV.  Sheets and towels did not smell clean.  The pool is quite nice, but unable to use as the local children who live in the complex ran riot and put sun beds in it.",Bad
"Wear a hard hat. A building site, could not relax for the sound & sights of drilling, more workmen than guests. 
surrounding area is very remote & run down - $50 taxi round trip to playas Americas.",Bad
Weather and pool area were nice.. The hotel runs cheap rooms at full capacity.  They put customers in rooms facing road works with drainage problems.  Water ran brown at times with terrible smell.  Management knew these rooms were bad but still sold them.  Bad wifi!!!!  Cost 25 euros and didnot work avoid this hotel !!!!,Bad
"were helped with bags upon arrival.. Up a really steep hill (and then you have to go partially down the hill to get to your apartment). Not near a bus stop. 
Apartment was dark, and backyard for drying clothes had not been swept for a while. Kitchen area and plates seemed to be covered in a thin layer of grease. Saw one cockroach, but the biggest pests are the cats, so that food can't be left alone for a minute on the rather dismal terrace, and patio door can't be left open. 
Worst things were that 
[1]. booking.com  describes  the apartment for 3,that we booked, amongst others, as having a double bed. When I brought this up with hotel reception they said no apartments on the complex have double beds! Upon my return I complained to booking.com about this, and they sent a standard reply thanking me for bringing it to their attention. More than a week later they're still describing these apartments as having double beds! and, 
[2]. The only bedding you're given is a very thin blanket each, far too inadequate for nights of around 13°C. We had booked 3 nights but left after one night, and had to pay at a higher rate for the pleasure of only staying one night...",Bad
what I would have expected 100 years ago.. what I would have expected 100 years ago. very old TV and just not what we expected,Bad
"Will never go back there and won't recommend any of my friends again.. No air condition and we hadrive to renthe a fan for €15 and deposited  €10.
Clean towels every second day meaning we have to clean with dirty towels till new ones come. 
No watching machine.
No washing liquid.
No animals in the apartments.
Electronic equipment in the kitchen don't work properly. 
No entertainment in the pool area like other hotels. 
Bar near the pool closes very early.
Drinks are expensive.
No complementary service at all.",Bad
"will not be back at this property.. building is filthy, run down and badly needing freshened up. no kettle in room, we were offered a saucepan to boil water on arrival, still waiting. had to hire kettle",Bad
"Won't be going here again!. Staff weren't friendly, and rude when asked for things at the pool bar such as huffing and puffing. My shower was broken and there was no hot water to run a bath, when told about it said they would fix it but never did",Bad
Worst ever stay. The beds were really springy... The apartment smelt the pillow had foam in them dirty bed sheets no balcony,Bad
"Worst hotel Ive been in on Tenerife!!!!. Cleaning is awful, location is bad, wifi is terrible,  tools in the kitchen are far away to few, to mant things in the kitchen missing, fecs, knives, spoons etc, then there are no instruments for cleaning the apartments specially in the kitchen fecs raks and brush for dishes!!! Dont understand thos hotel and will never go there again...",Bad
"Worst place ever, avoid!. This accomodation was awful, the worst I've seen.  The room had a horrible smell, it was dirty and dark.  Really depressing.  There were stickers from bikini gussets stuck to the side of drawers, the fridge was disgusting, cooker was rusted, there was hair in the wardrobes.  Smears all over glass surfaces, curtains hanging off.  Truly dreadful.  Had to leave and go elsewhere and still in dispute with hotel and booking.com.  I was only permitted to add 5 photos or I would have added more.  I am still waiting on the manager of the property calling me (8 days later) as the receptionist took details and advised she would",Bad
Would not  stay there again. The rooms fully dull and no Sun and any views from balconys,Bad
"Would not recommend the the Riosol.. All the add ons very annoying. Wifi, tv and air conditioning. These additions quickly mount up and end up pushing costs up to where we would have been better off going to a 5 star hotel.
The towels provided were thread bare and ragged. The lighting around the place was very poor and extremely dangerous given that there are so many steps. The food was over priced and not very nice.",Bad
"Would not recommened unless they refurbish and buliding works are finished. The apartment was very dated.  There were 3 mugs 1 had no handle 1 was chipped and 1 was ok.  There was no oven.
There is renovation work going on at 2 hotels across the road so was constant noise from 7 am to 9 pm so was not really a comfortable and relaxing holiday.  There appears to be other apartments being built around as well so will be noisy area for quite a while.
There needs to be a few more restaurants - quite a few had closed down.",Bad
Wouldnt return. Really bad smell from the fridge in our bungalow which when opened stank out the bungalow. No air conditioning and also had to pay for wifi,Bad

"Glad to be away from Alborada after 5Weeks.. There wasn't a restaurant it was a canteen with painted chairs and the paint peeling off,paper table covers ,some of the balconies the concrete was broken off and you could see the iron casing,the paint was also peeling off the whole place.There was people living there who owned dogs one lady had 3dogs, when you went in the lift the smell was awful after the dogs had been in .You had to go outside to go to the Canteen for your meals and 2of the days we were there it rained so by the time we got to the Canteen my hair was a mess and there was pot holes along the way,it was a complete nightmare.I think Booking . Com would have to look into Alboada Beach Club or take it off their books ,or get a spot check on the place.",Bad
"Good food, but don't do it if your looking for a bit of luxury.. The studio apartment  did not come up to scratch. No mountain views nor flat screen TV as advertised on Booking.com. Poor quality decor and furniture, A sparsely equipped kitchenette. No free wi-fi. North facing balcony was never used. I could go on... I would rate the room as 1 star. Absolutely not worth 111 euros per night that I paid for a single room.",Bad
"Good location, spacious apartments.. The floor was dirty already when we arrived. We didn´t recieve cleaning 4 imes/week, only 2 times during our stay.",Bad
leaving. it is an insult to say this but its like going back to the 1960s the state of the appartments is very very poor,Bad
like the place but would not stay in that apartment again.. Not value for money. Pool still not open,Bad
"Location. Dated hotel in a good location. Stuck in a time warp. Very expensive /premiumn prices a total mismatch considering how poor the decor & facilities (broken/rusty) are. Obv appeals to regular (older) clientelle who seem to like limited (no!) change & the hotel are taking full advantage of this. Staff were all polite & helpful, which is a positive. We would not stay here again though even if it was cheaper!",Bad
"NITEMARE HOTEL. the whole hotel ,very outdated, old fashioned, deco shabby,felt like cell block h prision ,had loads cracks every where tiles walls, holes, splits in doors, bedding and towels was  old, pool was always freezing, staff so rude , unpleasant very unhelpful , New Year's Eve entertainment was absolutely rubbish nothing for the younger children, superior rooms should be the bogg standard,men had to wear trousers for restraunt, don't know why was like a cattle market food was under cooked always cold , no clean cutlery on hand waitress never spoke, never got greeted in or out, upgraded to vip, no different to normally all inclusive, told to join normal que instead of standing at vip que, my brothers socket was hanging of wall for 2days in his room , he ended up getting electric shock of it, then they put champagne fruit and stuff in his room, we had a huge hole in our bath where it had been filled several times before, then on way down to reception in the lift it stopped so we was stuck in lift for 15 mins, we had 3 different rooms the whole of our stay the other family with us one of them slipped on a spilt drink on way out of reception so we asked for a 1st aid person to have look at her ankle, they don't have one in the hotel don't have 1st aid box or accident book,  , if it wasn't for the fact we arrived New Year's Eve we would have moved hotels , but was 3 families and all the decent rated 4star hotels was full, no way this is a 4star hotel, the only good thing is the  location, we asked to speak to the manager and got told was his day of, one of the busiest day out of the year!",Bad
"Nothing. Everything, you will love the price, but the rest u will hate!
I went to another hotel because i couldn't bare it anymore.",Bad
"OK IF YOUR LIKE 75+. Was interrupted while talking on the phone by staff, saying keep quiet! Yet a group of people were talking loud and making a lot of noise the next day and that seemed ok!",Bad
Plenty of sun loungers around the pool.. Accommodation opposite a building site operational 24/7.,Bad
"The bed linen did not change within two weeks.. The bed linen did not change within two weeks. Doors of numbers are closed with knock, is audible as the neighbors, each their voice come and leave. Internet very bad. few days in general was absent.  You can close eyes to these shortcomings. We are come to Gran Canaria not to stay in the hotel all time. But noise from the highway which passes under windows is awful and disposes to rest at night. For the same money it is possible to find hotel far away from roads and it is better than quality. To completion of all troubles in hotel can arrive group of hot Spanish girls, and you can forget about silence. Music, screeming, singing, knocking by a door and furniture will not calm down neither in the afternoon, nor at night. Can forget about normal rest for some days.",Bad
The rudest staff we have ever known.. Blonde Receptionist exceptionally rude and ignorant. As we saw other people advising cleaners they wouldn't be leaving till later we assumed we could do the same. The abuse we suffered was unbelievable. We would never go back,Bad
"`Park Resorts/Haven camp' in the sun!!!. Hated the fact that people were reserving sunbeds at 6 o'clock in a morning then not seen sat on them till maybe lunch or after.  Not enough mattresses for sunbeds or umbrellas for essential shade.  Having stayed here before, we thought the range of food for lunch and dinner was not as good as used to be, although we did like the improvements to the range at the pool bar. Disappointed that we were often waiting for a clean plate to get our food or for the food to be replenished.  One day, they had even run out of butter therefore had to have dry bread for lunch. Think they should also go back to being able to scoop your own ice-cream from a large tub in the restaurant, and need a better choice of deserts. Even though we were all inclusive, we went out to eat about 6 times in the 2 weeks for a change.  Was nice, but got fed up of tuna, salad and chips. Was a nightmare getting served in the entertainment bar in an evening (there was no chance of getting drunk!)  However, 2 days before we left they introduced `help yourself' beer pumps which was great and eased the queues.
If you want a peaceful holiday, dont come here!  It's very noisy.  We didnt get a proper nights' sleep in the whole 2 weeks. It would appear that families come here and while the adults are trying to get as much beer down their necks as possible they let their kids run riot around the complex.  We witnessed children chasing around, climbing on walls and in the plants and pointing lazer pens at people, and generally being let to just run out of control.The parents didn't seem to care so long as they could drink as much as possible. Young couple above us were a nightmare, singing shouting and swearing most nights till at least 3 in the morning.  We did complain a number of times.  Came home feeling more tired.",Bad
"2 swimming pools, life guard, good location to get to local.... Noise. We were close to reception and most people had to pass our residence to access theirs. It kept waking ourselves and our small children up. Not many reception staff spoke English.",Bad

"A big disappointment!. It was a bad experience and big disappointment for us. Reception staff very unfriendly and unwelcoming . The apartment door was noisy and difficult to open specially for old people. It wasn't safe, a drunk guy was sleeping just behind our apartment door and there was nobody in reception to inform about it. We booked from 1 to 9 of July but we found another place and we left the apartment after 2 days.",Bad
A good holiday not spoilt by poor accommodation.. Room was shabby. There was a lack of electrical points in the kitchen part. 2 electrical points were hanging loose.,Bad
"A lady in the reception - friendly and nice.. Crowded restaurant, military canteen style. Insipid food. Views on the block of flats area of EasternEuropean post-Soviet charm. A long walk to the beach or any other interesting place. No parking with high traffic streets around - when you find a place, better keep it for all your stay. Street noises. Motorway noises. Room noises. If unlucky, plenty of stairs to climb every time you want to come back from anywhere. Complicated geography. The pool was empty because of cold water, but I believe hot summers  will change into the soup with noodles.",Bad
A total disaster not enjoyable hotel rooms poorly located front section area beautiful. Gotel room not fit for purpose would never book a h 10 hotel again,Bad
A very disappointing holiday. No hot water had to wait half hour for water to heat up after one shower. Wanted to print boarding passes for to go home they would not do it. Not a great place for children most of the time it was allolder people it was very isolated would not recommend it for anyone some apartments had hot tubs had asked for one didn't get very disheartening to see some apartments having one if I had seen review about it it been a timeshare apt I would never have booked it so anyone reading this my advice is run a waste of good money,Bad
"absolute let down and spent 24 hours of a 4 day break here just trying to resolve problems. do not stay or book at this hotel we stayed their on 18th Nov 2016. The spa and wellness suites are not open the gym is not even built or starting to be built. The Bar is not stocked or manned, there is no restaurant menu or lunch menu. Taxis will not take you to the hotel as they do not know where it is, it is not exclusively Gay as advertised and they sell the rooms to just anyone the doors are wide open to the street so anyone can just walk in, disappointed to have to write this review after complaining to the hotel and booking.com, but I see that booking.com are still allowing the hotel to market all the facilities despite photos that evidence everything above, I sincerely don't want anyone to feel so let down as we did. Called and spoke to booking.com today 30/11/2016 to express concerns that hey are still allowing the hotel to market services or facilities that are not actually available.",Bad

"Avoid. I have previously given this hotel good reviews but can no longer recommend it. The noise from the adjoining nightclub was unbelievably loud, rising to a crescendo at 4am and continuing until 5am. I could not sleep even with ear plugs, and was moved to a small room in the centre of the hotel where amazingly the music could still be heard. This room had insects crawling all over the bathroom. To top it off, the restaurant tablecloths and chairs got dirtier every day, do they ever clean them?",Bad

"awful. the food was awful and even though we were all inclusive we ended up eating out at the local restaurants. we got fed up of chips and slimey rubber meat. there is not enough choice and no flavours. the staff in the bar and restaurant were rude to us on more than one occasion. not wanting to be helpful but then we saw them being really pally with the locals! we complained to the manager as not only was the WiFi, card machines, cigarrette machine, pool tables and vending machines not working, but as a couple in our twenties we were told at 9pm we couldn't play ping pong as it was ""too late"" even though we played it at 11pm the night before ! we also asked for more clean towels as they weren't changed over 3 days and we were told we would have to wait until the next day for cleaning to change them ! all inclusive was a huge let down and simple things like cheeseburgers u have to pay for in the day!!! u have to go in the restaurant at set times or u go hungry basically. we did not meet another person there that was genuinely pleased with the place. we heard lots of others sounding disappointed. after complaining to the manager we got given a tablet with WiFi connectivity for the rest of te holiday but that and the towels were the only problems that got addressed. we spent most of our days away from alborada as every day there was some let down about something not working or someone being snappy with us. our room was supposed to be a deluxe double but we got two single beds pushed together with a measly blanket. you do not get treated with any hospitality instead ur made to feel like your asking too much. the restaurants nearby said they get people coming from alborada all the time as the food is so bad and most people agreed and knew with what we were saying about the place!",Bad
"Bad choice. I dont know where they get elegance from, the hotel has not been updated since I was last there, 36 years ago! Paint and wallpaper peeling off, pillows were probably 36 years old as well, large old TV's, only 1 working socket, bacon under cooked, not enough toasters, paper table cloths, everything done on the cheap with absolutly no maintance. I dont know how they can claim 4 stars, more like 1.",Bad
"BAD MANAGEMENT. Management was micro managing staff but wasn't available to give them authorization.  They had no idea that I was coming.
I requested early check in and Booking.com said that they contacted the property but never heard any more. There was no buzzer on the gate. I got in when someone exited.  I told staff that I had a reservation and the response was, ""How did you get in here?""  He told me I had to wait until 2 (kept repeating that even though I saw 3 of the 7 units leave by 11:30).  I had to wait for about 3-4 hours and they wouldn't let me use a bathroom.  The staff tried to reach the manager during that time.  I had to leave to find a public bathroom. No buzzer on gate. Had to make international calls to get someone to open the gate after hanging up on me 2 times. Maids must have used dirty water to mop.  I bought paper towel and cleaned the floor.  The towel turned brown with one swipe.  An old man appeared several times during my week's stay (I assumed that he was the manager).  For most of the week, there was only 1 other unit occupied.  The manager (if he was the manager) never acknowledged me nor apologized for the non-hospitable check in.
The place is supposedly new and the room safes were not ready even though I was promised that it would be.  There was a small cheap chest with drawers about 6-8 inches deep. Couldn't use the top drawer  because the safe hung over it from the top of the unit.
There was no place to put stuff except on the coffee table or floor. The yard was covered with plastic grass with the seams visible.  I sat at the pool a couple day and never saw the staff after the breakfast so I'm not sure what their function was.  There were no amenities or attempts to even pretend that they were going to show hospitality.",Bad

"Beatiful views over the mountains.. This review is not for the Atlantic Sun Beach since I was kindly asked to stay at THE SEVEN HOTEL & WELLNESS instead due to renovations. This place is according to me punching way above its weight. Imagine someone who have never skied before who purchase the most expensive skiequipment and the fanciest skidress heading for the French alps. The fancy surface will soon be revealed in the slopes.. 
E.g. it doesn't matter how fine porcelain you put on the table if the service and the food is really poor. 
The atmosphere over the whole place is rather dead and impersonal which includes the interior in the bungalows.
I though hope the place will find its character in due time since someone invested a lot of money in this project.",Bad

"Below average hotel in need of serious update. The staff spoke barely any English and so any queries we had were never understood and we were left none the wiser. The hotel in general is extremely dated, our bathroom had cracked tiles, mould along the edge of the bath, and the shower fitting had broken so we had to hold the shower ourselves and attempt to not flood the bathroom. Be aware - what they advertise as a double room is actually a twin room - it took us about 45 mins to explain that we wanted a double bed and not two single ones! Eventually we changed rooms to find the dirty damaged bathroom and a double bed with sheets that didn't cover the whole of the bed. With the difficulty of changing rooms, we decided we couldn't be bothered with the whole charade again and made do.

Disgusting. Nothing at all,Bad
"Dissapointing. apartment was of s poor standard, had to move apartments due to the poor standard of the first one, second one was not much better, no TV availble, bathroom was continualys leaking eater from the bath, constsant noise from building works during our stay,overall a dissapointment and not what was expected for the cost.",Bad
Dissapointing visit. no facilities were available as building work still being carried out and had an empty swimming pool and no relaxing area throughout my stay. No compensation offered although I only asked for a very small amount of around 40euros for a meal voucher to the restaurant just across the road.,Bad
"Отличный шведский стол на завтрак.. Нас встретили бокалом шампанского...на этом положительные эмоции закончились. Отель достаточно под уставший, с частичным ремонтом то здесь, то там, старая ванная, потрепанные полотенца, нет чайника и кофе набора в комнате, нет интернета, только в лобби и то с трудом. Отсутствие русского телевидения - признак russians not welcome!Собственного пляжа нет, только бассейн. При том, что цена комнат достаточно высока лежаки на террасе платные?!  Наше пребывание заканчивалось в 5 утра и мы, естественно не успевали на завтрак, который стоит, на минуточку 30 евро, я предложила менеджеру отеля поменять его на обед эквивалентной суммы. На что мне в резкой форме было отказано, мол в правила отеля это не входит и вот уже 30 лет их никто не менял и для нас этого делать не будет. Зато был предложен сухой паек в виде набора булочек и пачки йогурта, что совсем не соответствовало объявленной стоимости. Но, видимо соответствовало интересам отеля. 
Вывод: отель не стоит заявленным звездам и цене!
The worst hotel ever I met! Old and small room, old bathroom, no kettle and tea set, no Internet at the room, just at the lobby. Chargeable sunbed at Lounge terrace! The breakfast that we couldn't use (30 euro) hotel manager rudely refused to exchanged for an equivalent price lunch. The client's interest is not in the interests of the hotel! The price and the service does not match the quality!",Bad
"do not go here!!!. this was a terrible place to stay. it was dated, only enough hot water for one shower, (there was 4 of us there. my pregnant wife, 2 young kids and myself) water running down the bathroom wall from above the ceiling, the sofa bed my kids slept on was falling to pieces. we weren't given keys for the front door or pool,     the room key had been snapped and taped together.",Bad
"Do not stay here. Very noisey due to a major problem resident in next apartment block 
There is a political activist in next block broadcasting a political speach on full volume from his balcony continuously from morning to night we could not use our balcony or the pool or even have apartment windows open it drove us mad
Do not stay here 
The management have known about problem for 12 months but do not inform guests",Bad
Do not stay here.. The rooms are very basic and unclean.There was not even a kettle in my room.,Bad
don't bother. The food and the staff were all miserable,Bad
"Don't bother. There are much better places for the same money.. Food, cleanliness,cockroaches, smell of sewerage",Bad
"Don't go on this Hotel and special not to Las Galetas! Go to Los Cristianos, Las Americas or Adeje!. I didn't like the way how they did the pictures from website. The pictures are different than reality. By the photos hotel looks like a cool place but in reality looks like a 1990 hotel stantards full up with old couples, not a problem with old couples but we didn't enjoyed. I didn't like the way how the people staring on my tattooss :))",Bad
Don't stay in this apartment. The complex is ok but a bed without pillows holes in towel. Filthy bar. No pillows,Bad

Dreadful. Because having to make all the phone call to get into my apartment,Bad
"enjoyed, my stay, very friendly hotel, great location, clean, very good staff.. nan",Bad
"Falling apart in every sense. The Monopol is one of those places that uses old photos to advertise but the reality is tired and very unloved. Our first room smelt of sewage, had mould on the walls, the worst mattress known to man, a 'hair dryer' that was actually a hose pipe, a sink about to fall off the wall and pillows as flat as a pancake as some of it's best features. On complaining to the indifferent staff we got moved to another room, which although much better, was still dirty and full of the other guests cigarette smoke. It also had a feature in common with the first room a marble sink that could collapse at any moment!
It seems like the guests here are almost exclusively chain-smoking German OAP's. Nothing at all against the Germans but don't exactly expect a Spanish themed breakfast is all I'm saying! 
I expect this hotel gets business purely on it's location - which is great. However there are plenty of other (less mouldy and smelly) hotels with a good location that you should choose instead. My advice - AVOID",Bad
False economy. Food terrible. Some of the staff rude and unhelpful. Rooms very basic and hot water not constant. Room only cleaned every other day.,Bad
"Far away from beach
. Far away from beach
 Poor equitmented kitchen",Bad
Far to quite. Nothing to do at night and not enough places to eat out at night.,Bad
"Faulty towers. Location is awful, beds where like something from private Benjamin, rooms where tiny (1bed apt), bathroom was literally walking with mould, dozens of stray cats everywhere, chocolate and fruit in the ""supermarket"" where out of date, paid once for the breakfast buffet for what could only be described as burnt slop, air conditioning was completely ineffective. Wanted money off us for everything (iron, TV remote, wifi etc. just a really poor experience overall. Photos of this property are very misleading, obviously taken when they 1st opened and hasn't had so much as a lick of paint since . Pool and surrounds where filthy with cat excrement and dead bugs. Really can't stress enough how important it is to avoid this place.",Bad

German ? Fine ! English? Give it a wide berth!!. Staff counting how many drinks we had !,Bad
"Good location and good swimming pool garden. Extremely small balconies, uncomfortable sofa and chairs in apartment, water leakage around toilet, and who chargaes for wifi today?",Bad
"Good Location, But poor quality accomodation for the price that you pay.  Receptionist very rude. value for money was rubbish.  we also paid for 5 people to stay and only received linen for 4 , when questioned was told madam this is only a three star accomodation, surely if you have paid for 5 people to stay you should receive 5 sets of towels and linen. Receptionist was very rude.   No hairdryers either",Bad
"Good Location.... Had to pay for wifi,tv",Bad
Good looking hotel now tired with poor service. Ants in room poor service,Bad
"Great breakfasts, lots of variety although often slow.... Very disappointing rooms & noise level was terrible in the mornings in room 279 due to us being next to service rooms, restaurant & gym so clanking bottles & trolleys being rattled over the tiled floors!",Bad
"Great holiday - hotel not so. Food was terrible, pillows were like empty tea bags and beds were for midgets",Bad
"Great little complex and location. Apartment 114 rubbish!!

apartment was old,dirty,damaged and not maintained.Kitchen cupboards old
and water damaged cracks in the work top.light fixtures not working or
missing bulbs. Dirty,smelly bedding,cushions and covers. Shower curtain
stained and mouldy bathroom ceiling had water damage. No English tv as
advertised. No sun on the balcony at all during the day.
",Bad
"Great location but hotel needs an overhaul.. The room was dark ,cold and depressing ,no sunlight on the balcony and no view at all.Not enough storage space for clothes.The sofa bed was dirty fortunately did not need to use this.There was no fridge in the room although there was a kitchen behind louvre doors screwed together.Requested an upgrade on the room was prepared to pay but told none available for weeks ! my sister and brother in law arrived with us and their booking couldn't be found and they spent the first night at another hotel when they arrived back the next day they were offered a choice of superior room with pool or sea view .Limited choice of food and replenishment was slow and often non existent .
Bar staff seemed to think it was ok to give you anything other than what you asked for.Ended up eating and drinking out a lot.
Pool towels were available but if you wanted a clean one you had to pay 1euro for it.
On the whole staff not very helpful and the the rooms need updating none of the interior doors would close,it just looked shabby.",Bad
Great location very poor apartment. The place needs a good clean. Everything time I got something out that I had not used in the kitchen it needed washing.little ants everywhere.  When we had a shower the bathroom flooded so that floor was clean not . Bedding was old and not very fresh.  Good job it had a washer because we didn't want to use the towels till they had been washed. The pool was out of use for most of are stay .,Bad
"Great view, pleasant staff, very dated lacking facilities.. Receptionists were pleasant and professional at all times.",Bad
"Hate it, would never come back.. Room was dirty, full of ants and one day we found a cockroach on our bathroom. Room was not like described on booking, when we complained the recepcionist said that that's what you get for paying cheap. Well that was very expensive for what we got,and you don't say that for you guests! Very bad Internet connection.",Bad
"Helpful staff.. Kitchen practically not functional. Oven never worked. Kitchen furniture destroyed, bed wobbly, cockroaches everywhere. There was an old tube TV, but no remote control, and very bad quality picture. No wifi, no phone. The worst possible room facilities. The restaurant was not bad, neither was the food.",Bad
"hopefully, it was for ONE night. It was really dirty, and the welcoming not so nice. It is a very old appartment. There is stairs everywhere, and with a lugage, apartement are a bit difficult to access (limited lift)",Bad
Horrible. The rooms are not upto date and very poor conditions,Bad
"Hostel of last resort.. No atmosphere,  no wifi (it's 2015!) gloomy grubby little place, that's obviously why it was available.",Bad
Hot and Sticky. The rooms were extremely hot and there was no air-conditioning. There was one overhead fan in the bedroom and none in the living room and the staff were very unconcerned  There was a lot of noise due to building work.,Bad
"Hotel that tries to be both self-catering and all-inclusive, isn't great at either. Food was bad. Coffee - dishwater. I can't believe you charge people for drinks at dinner, even water.",Bad
housing is not an apartment but it was originally a shop and.... housing is not an apartment but it was originally a shop and you notice the entrance with a sliding door on the walkway where anyone passing can see you and especially not any windows in the rooms and even in the bathroom and the musty smell and constantIn the photos these details are not highlighted,Bad

"I do not recommend Hotel Maga !!!. I do not recommend Hotel Maga! On site look great, but when you get into the room things change radically. Starting with the smell of the room, to the linen and cleaning. It smells like old furniture, linen was not freshly washed and towels were stained. The bed was uncomfortable, old and to small. We asked for a double bed, but I got room with separate bed. The breakfast was poorly!",Bad
"I honestly can not give a positive response.. Outdated hotel, nursing home, the area is like Eastbourne. nm good for children. Not for the middle class of all ages. Reminds me of 1970 package holiday the area with bed bugs. Honestly please don't go.",Bad
"I really do not know :(. It was dirty. We had to change the room, because it was cleaned badly.
You cannot reach the beach, even thou it looks close. You have to walk few kilometers",Bad
"I will never come back.. The staff did not appear when we arravided, nor when we left. My handbag was stolen inside of the area of the bungalows Las Almenas.
It was only cold water in the bungalow, until next day when we told them. It was not wine-glasses, very few plates etc.",Bad
"iberostar basic hotel. Very basic room, rooms not cleaned properly even after several complaints food average. Balcony tiny and overlooking car park. Would not stay here again",Bad
"It could have been a nice holiday, unfortunately............ I really wanted to like this place. I needed a restful, stress-free holiday. Reading the earlier reviews, I thought the hotel looked good it wasn't perfect and being new, it just needed some last minute fixing. I am not a difficult customer and a nice easy-going guy. I usually leave good reviews and I am always quite thankful for any kind of reasonable service. I say this before I start, because I think this has been my worst stay in Gran Canaria in almost 20 years. It's not as much about the quality of the complex, but more about being treated like a fool.
I left the property today and I  have to get this off my chest.
Here are just a few of the ""incidents"" that slowly got me totally fed up.
1) The ""arrival""- I arrived at a normal reasonable time-15h30. I got to the complex and I rang the bell for over 15 minutes with no answer. Outside there is a big sign that states ""call this number in case of emergency or late arrival"". I never considered calling it (first error) because I thought it didn't concern me. A guest finally arrived from the beach and let me in. He told me that there was no one there and I had better call the number. So I did. The owner answered and without an apology, he said he'll be there in 5 minutes. He arrives 1/2 hour  later. He's a very nice guy, but completely overworked trying to manage his different resorts, one in Maspalomas.  With a big smile, he quickly swiped my credit card, gave me the wifi code and said he'll be back soon with my invoice and all the info I need.
2) The ""restaurant""- I paid for half board and the owner said that when he comes back, he'll give me the menu. This was the beginning of a bad movie. The ""restaurant"" is a breakfast room with 6 tables (note: the breakfast looks nothing like the pictures) and I asked him if I would be eating there. He quickly ignored the question and told me he will be back soon.",Bad
"It is like very cheap hostel, where you hear every sound, so.... It is like very cheap hostel, where you hear every sound, so with loud drunk people you cannot sleep. Wifi is working only at reception,  and room was very simple - for the price I experienced better services.",Bad
"It was a typical hotel where they want to fleece you when.... It was a typical hotel where they want to fleece you when you arrive had to pay for wifi,tv etc",Bad
It was an ideal base for us for two days. No air condition was clean but could really do with a revamp brought up to date,Bad
"It was ok but I would not go back. -Brown smelly towels, very old Over used .
-Grey bed sheets that were over used with marks on.
-The named sofa bed was not actually a sofa bed it was just a sofa that couldn't bend...
- We saw a cockroach in the kitchen sink..
- Internet is not provided you pay separately but then it does not connect you have to keep entering password and super slow.
- Partment 13 is near busy main road so there is noise from big vehicles passing ...
- No microwave, yet the place is advertised as an apartment with everything.
- Old coffee maker which is  so slow to make cofffee..
- no kettle provided to boil water.
- Electric sockets not working . Sometimes they would and other times are off..
- Shower head and taps were old nearly falling off..
- Boiler hot water was not enough for three people, we had to wait to heat more water to have a shower.
- The manager seems moody and not welcoming but staff is very nice, chatty and welcoming and listening ..",Bad
"It was very much Fawlty Towers in Cell block H. Where do you start, this hotel is not a 4 star hotel , maybe a basic 2 star. It has more of a council block look about it. the hotel requires a complete refurbishment, its drab, dated and no atmosphere.
Only one electric socket in bedroom worked, and one in the living area, lots of electric light switches but finding the one that actually operated the lights was an endurance test every night.
Drinks were served in plastic cups, that looked as though they had been supplied by the local dentist. As for all inclusive.. every drink we asked for they were chargeable. cocktails only two were free, already made in a machine, and the bar staff well not very happy when asked to make fresh ones.
The swimming pool was like Gods waiting room, no music and no atmosphere and certainly cold.
As for entertainment, well that was supplied by the guests and the amount of stag parties.
Food fine, but sometimes the chefs couldn't tell you if you were eating pork or  beef.
Not somewhere I would recommend to anyone",Bad
"It's cheap for a reason!. The whole hotel was extremely tired, the barman was the grumpiest old man alive, don't ask him for a coffee in a cup accept the paper ones.",Bad
Just average. The apartment facilities were basic. Towels had seen better days. Bed uncomfortable and apartment wasn'tcleaned properly. There was still dirt on balcony that had been there for 3 days.,Bad
"Just the once, please. The appartment looked like living quarters from the 70's, I was never lonely though. Ants and cockroaches kept me company",Bad
"large rooms, kitchen facilities.. Location, charges for tv and wi-fi. The rooms are in need of a lot of TLC [loose floor tiles] shabby bed covers,large damp patches over bath. Pathetic fitness room and heated swimming pool the size of household bath.",Bad
"location. room, shared shower / toilet, which was cleaned at 9am. Bed sheets had holes and the towel was threadbare",Bad
Location. The hotel breakfast was awful they did not cater for vegetarians. No fruit at breakfast only oranges. Tables were too close together making in difficult to go around. Staff constantly going in between tables clearing dishes which took up space. Bathroom doors had a inch gap all way around no lock no privacy. Entertainment was poor bar closed at 11pm. Internet was ridiculasly slow. Would not stay there again,Bad
location. most other things were negative,Bad
"Location is good. To much noise from celibrating the nicht partys.
the apartments small, Old",Bad
"Location is good if you have a car.. Cold showers the entire time. Internet was only in reception area for 6
Euros an hour. Breakfast buffet closes at 10. Cold Swimming Pool (Not
heated). Bed was broken. Restaurant serves terrible food.
",Bad
"Location of apartments.. Very dated apartments with broken crockery and furniture. Charged 8% extra on top of initial bill for servicing apartment which in the 6 days we were there only included adding 2 toilet rolls. No change of towels, sheets or cleaning of any kind.",Bad
"Location was good. terrible showers,towels dont dry you,beds very creaky and uncomfortable, bedroom sweat bath,location of sun at pool very poor and pool freezing,gate not always open,maid bangs on door instead of knocking,worst apartment we have stayed in,location only good point.",Bad
"Location was great, but service was terrible. This place is an absolutely ghost hotel.
We we're said that a person will be in the reception all time but nobody was there at all.
The number provided on the website and booking ring but nobody answer! the only to get in contact with someone was by the cleaning lady.",Bad
"Location.. Rooms/Decor desperately needsupdating. Poor facilities. None of the Outdoor gymn equipment worked. Wifi very slow at far end of complex. 
Kids club reps were lovely. However the Reception staff not very helpful, especially for info on local restaurants and New Years celebrations. NYE dinner/buffet was a complete rip off at  200 euros. Entertainment was very poor. Would not stay here again.",Bad
"Loud and description is misleading, a bad choice!!!. - The description of this apartment is misleading!!! Looks like 4 star hotel, but not!!!
It is a private offer. The apartment is in a residential area.
- The apartment is not maintained well. Broken door, lamps and chair
- The parking situation during the weekend is terrible. 
- Since it is located near to the main street, loud in the night.
- Bad price performance ratio",Bad
"Lovely holiday, dreadful accommodation. We had to wait for 1 hour for the owners agent to turn up with the key. The apartment was dirty , I had to clean the fridge, the sinks and  the toilet before we could use them. 
It was lacking in cutlery and crockery, luckily we weren't cooking, and each evening a hoard of bugs came out of a hole near the sink.
the apartment above was being renovated so a lot of hammering and drilling.
So glad we were only there for 4 nights",Bad
"Lovely pool, even tho it's freezing, plenty of sunbeds.... Food its attriocious, the hotel bar is not good, drinks served in plastic glasses  and the entertainment is rubbish. Rooms are supposed to be cleaned 4 times a week and bed changed once a week and towels 3 times a week, my room was sort of cleaned twice bed not changed at all and towels twice in 8 nights!! Went self catering but you have to pay for kettle toaster microwave!! Beds are rock hard and you get 1 skinny pillow. Will not be returning!",Bad
"Make yourself a favour and choose another place to stay. We felt like a dog in a cage. The appartment is isolated in the middle of nowhere, the taxi is quite expensive to go to town and they do not know where to come....we had to talk 30 minutes on the phone with the lady from the taxi company becase the taxi did not find us...the adress is a total mistery, the ones given on booking are wrong. The terrase is a joke, meaning that the wind was so strong that there is no way you could enjoy the view. If you don't have a car you feel captive in a trap with no possibility of leaving. Even with a car, the place is very very far and difficult to get to. The price is very high for what you are given. We paid for two nights and preffered to leave after one night with the money spent than stay one more night there.",Bad
"Martianez, Shopping Centre (200 m). The food isn't always fresh.
Tea, coffee and juices aren't availale at dinner and lunch.
There was no comfort in our room, aside from old beds and the tv there is nothing else in the room.
There is no parking and we could only place our car a kilometere away from the hotel.
It is loud in the hotel till 2am.
This hotel deserves 2 stars and not 4.",Bad
"Max 2 stars hotel. Facilities, staff, customer service was very poor.",Bad
"Most terrible resort hotel ever. Island Tenerife, nothing in the hotel.",Bad
"Near of Jumbo. The cleaner changes only the towels, the man at the enter smokes inside...
Very no quiet",Bad
Needs refurbishing badly. Stayed before but VERY run down and getting very pricey for what was on offer.never booking this place again.took ages to check in kept saying rooms were booked but they had no names,Bad
"Never again. When we checked in the man on receptions just check us in, take the money, give us a key but never explain anythings about our stay or  what was in the room.
There was no remote control for telly we find out later that we have to give 20 Euro deposit, and No Kettle to boil water to make a cup of coffee or tea suppose to be a service apartment ( we have to used saucepan ). 
I asked a younger man in receptions a few questions about our transfer to the airport the answer is sorry don't know and don't try to help at all even I told him the flight is very early in the morning.
No changing bed linen at all for hold 6 nights stay, 
No soap to wash our hands after toilet, ( have to buy )
No washing up liquid or equipment to washing up.

Smell of dampness 
Bar closed at 6 
No balcony with sun lounger",Bad
"Never stay here, rip off. everything",Bad
never trust colorful pictures.. nan,Bad
NICE BREAKFAST SHAME ABOUT THE REST. If you pay for an apartment you expect to get at least the ability to spend a couple of nights in & cook for yourselves. This place was niether comfortable nor equiped to do so.  very poor level of any thing. For a town that has huge numbers of English speaking tourists they could not even be bothered to supply 1 channel in English on the TV.  Certainly would never stay there again.,Bad
"Nice layout, lovely pool.. Poor food, poor location",Bad
"Nice location but unfriendly staff. the room was cleaned every day but poorly, dust was left on the floor and bathroom mat was not changed for many days. Only one restaurant was open and it was always buffet.
We needed to make a call to police office but the reception first declined to help. After some discussions they allowed the call but reminded that it will cost a lot and I must remember to pay this. We saved some of our cash as they could not say how much the costs will be. on our check out we found that the costs were 72 eurocents!!!",Bad
Nice pool shame about the rest. Place run down looks like a concrete car park botched D.I.Y repairs every where. Around the pool missing tiles concrete finish worn out very hard on your feet. Food very poor went all inclusive got bad stomach and more.(ate out a lot),Bad
Nice view but 3rd bedroom not fit for use . To far from anything going on. No pool. One bedroom was almost an outhouse and not sealed from the elements. Not enough hot water or clean towels. Staff not very helpfull. Right at the top of the biggest steepest hill/mountain I have ever seen. Our knees are in bits from the hiking!,Bad
Nicely equipped kitchen.. Very bad anti social behaviour from drunk drug smoking vagrants swearing shouting and spitting under our balcony every day all day,Bad

Not a great place to stay.. The stuff was rude.They made the start of our honeymoon very uncomfortable.They make you buy towels for the pool because there is no service for that.Safe in the room also no free.No one explain how to get to hotel parking because parking on the street is for free.Very bad expirience.,Bad
Not a lot.. the trawl from reception to the lift and then the massive walk up many flights of steps to the apartment. No a/c and a ceiling fan that made the most horrible noise when switched on. Apartment was very dated.,Bad
"not a very good holiday. the apartment had pull down double bed,we asked for 2 singles,the next day a single chair bed arrived but not enough room to put in the main room,no bins in any room,no iron,no clothes hangers,towels and bedding not good",Bad
"Not as described. Too many stress

Not enjoyable. Everything,Bad
"Not fit for purpose. Where to start: As soon as we arrived we were asked for a Euro500 breakages deposit. The pool was being fixed, finally working by Tuesday. The dishwasher never did and smelt. Showerheads leaked, outdoor furniture broken ... Despite kind words from manager Saverio it was clear that the owner did not want to know. Until owner invests in his property, I would avoid Villa Chalet Azul.",Bad
"Not for the faint hearted. It was dirty with cockroaches, the water in taps was brown , the rooms were not cleaned properly. More like a 1 star",Bad
Not good. The apartment was very dated and dirty,Bad
Not luxury but perfectly adequate. Slight noise disturbance from adjacent apartments at night,Bad
"Not much .. Building work being carried out drilling noisey. Gas boiler faulty kept cutting out after a few minutes. It was fixed but when the repair men left two minutes later it cut off , the studio was noisey in the evening ,it sounded like furniture being moved all the time most nights. This studio 303 was a noisey location at a cross roads near bus station. No wi  fi anywhere.No reception. the bar and restaurant closed after a few days and is now for sale . These studios and apartments some are privately owned with family's living there permanently ,it does not feel like a holiday complex",Bad
Not much really. The staff were really rude in restaurant and reception. Same food near enough everyday with just a change of meat or fish. The pool was dirty everyday always cleaning and painting around the grounds with parts shut regularly. Children as young as 2 running around the gym unattended!! Check in was poor with bad communication and explanations on the hotel and the facilities also regarding half board entitlements.,Bad
Not my kinda place. checked our early. complex. pool and lack of staff,Bad
"Not recommended. Room was sub standard, dirty , ill equipped and dated. Desperately needs refurbishment.
Reception was useless !",Bad

Not what i was expecting - very poor. that we couldn't use the pool or pool area because they were continually drilling around the pool.  couldn't use the pool bar because it was shut.  I still haven't received my room deposit back and the room wasn't as shown in internet photos.,Bad
"Not worth at all. Dirty , old stinky towels , no rubbish bag or ant kind offesa soap , terribile smell",Bad
Not worth the all exclusive package. Staff attitude,Bad
"Not worth the money. Our room was never cleaned, flea bites off sofa on balcony. Had to go to reception for clean towels after 4 days. Elderly couple robbed whilst they slept. No security. No reception on Sunday. Not suitable for Families.",Bad
Not worth the money or headaches. Due to continuous building works in the bungalow next to us starting at 8:30 am to 4:30pm everyday during our stay we could not relax in our bungalow. Filter not working   in pool so it was too dirty to swim in. Cleaners didn't clean the bungalow for the entirety of the stay. Towels smelled musty. Two sets of keys for three adults made it awkward to come and go as we pleased.,Bad
"not worth the price. The room/design is outdated (reminded me of the 80 ies)
Wifi does not work for iphones, and they do not mention it until you arrive at the hotel and it took two days to make it work a little
The floor was never clean, and the sheets were never changed in a whole week",Bad
"Not worth to take all inclusive. Location great for those whith strong legs as there is many stairs.. All inclusive food and drinks were discussing, made me sick when I saw it. Not worth to pay a penny. Couldn't take a bottle of water, drinks only from plastic cups. Icecream and coffee available only at specific times. No fresh fruit and vegetables. Sunbeds only plastic,very hard and most of them broken.",Bad
Not worthy of a review. The couple above fought constantly for 10 days & nights & their baby started screaming each evening at 20-30 until 3-4am. The washing machine didn't work just left a flood everywhere & after informing the manager of said problem he did nothing. If you want to stay in a smelly over-priced noisey place then this is for you. The main highway is very close with constant traffic day & night which goes really well with the screaming baby & its parents. Looked forward so much to leaving terrible over-priced abode.,Bad

Wouldn't go back",Bad
"One to avoid. Rude and unhelpful staff, particularly those working in the pool facilities e.g the bar and towel hut. There is also a set of very illogical and pointless rules regarding opening times. 
Plenty of annoying holiday reps disturbing people at the pool asking to take part in activities (4/5 times a day).
No end of music being blared from speakers in the pool/outside area.
Without a doubt the worst half board dinner buffet I've experienced, and I'm not picky whatsoever. Uncooked food, no clean tables. I imagine similar service and quality would be experienced in a minimum security prison. 
The whole hotel was full of groups on package holiday tours. There were plenty of Thomson Holidays buses pulling up outside to say the least.",Bad

Overpriced and definitely not a four star hotel.. The bedrooms and bathrooms in this as a supposed  four star hotel were very poor. They were very small and outdated. The corridors were very dated also.,Bad
"People were nice there. Not easy to find
The equipment was really old",Bad
"Pool and solarium area was very good, plenty of beds and.... Room was extremely basic, kitchen had 1 pot and a frying pan, no storage containers no decent size glasses and fridge had no freezer section. Maybe small things but added together made it unsatisfactory.
Location of room was on level A1 which was basically the basement, the terrace was directly on to the esplanade so had security fencing which made it feel like a prison. Another guest described it like going into an underground car park, couldn't have described it better.
To get a change of room they wanted another 300 euros which basically was a 50% increase in the price and was not for an upgrade!!!!!!!!!!!!",Bad
Poor accommodation. The rooms need to be cleaned thoroughly and upgraded and STOP the time share touts within the complex spoiling your holiday,Bad
"Poor accommodation, never to be repeated.. 1) Waited over 20 minutes to check in.
2) Had no hot water for longer than 90 seconds for the entire stay (even after it was all supposedly fixed). It took me about an hour to get a full tub one day, and that was the best I could do after running back and forward to the tub. Shower? Forget it. Had to shampoo before stepping in.
3) Also, was greeted by a trampled bumble bee in the middle of the living room after the place was ""cleaned,"" and 2 of the 4 sofa pillows just disappeared one day. Bizarre.
4) The walls and ceilings are made of paper, cause I got woken up every single day by banging, knocking, people talking outside, etc. and all my windows were closed to no avail. Frustrating!
Wouldn't have complained this much if they would have offered themselves to adjust the bill, but it was only upon me insisting I shouldn't be paying full price after all that misery that they detracted some off the bill. No one in their right mind would book a place without hot water for starters.
Will never go back.",Bad
Poor entertainment. Unhelpful reception staff and oudated appartments. TV was an old 17 inch. Reception staff. We had to wait 2 hours to book in but they accepted payment. We then had to wait 2 more hours for the room to be cleaned.,Bad
"Poor quality and not very clean. Not very clean, had to get key and book in at another of their hotels some five minutes walk away. Could not get access to this hotel, so constantly had to call the booking telephone number to get any reception service. Could not use pool as had debris in it from the maintenance work that was going on. After a late check in the first morning I was woken by someone using a concrete breaker and angle grinder lest than 20 feet away from my bedroom.",Bad
"Poor value for money. No pots or cleaning equipment in the kitchen. The cupboards were not clean. The walls were uneven and needed painting. The furniture was not clean (stains on the sofa, dirty table). The resort was not well kept (many places falling apart or being redecorated, the sun terrace was missing sunbeds",Bad

Relax and undwined. Nothing,Bad
"Rooftop solarium is good and isolated from the rest of the.... Front desk staff is not very friendly and sometimes outright rude.
There is supposed to be WiFi in the rooms but it hardly works at all (it works fine in the lobby though). You might as well expect no WiFi in your room. 
Sloppy cleaning. 
Restaurant staff, with some exceptions, seem to really dislike their jobs (and the guests).
Buffet/restaurant is organized in a very strange way with many chokepoints and too many customers  in a small area. The food is bland.
Walls are paper thin. You'll hear neighbours snore every night.
The whole complex is tacky and worn down.
Seriously, unless you are returning to this place because you love it for some reason and don't want to try something new or if you get a massive discount, there are way better places to spend this kind of money. Don't simply trust the rating.",Bad
Room for improvement. Beds uncomfortable and kitchen equipment sparse.Difficult to find and park. Restaurant staff unfriendly.,Bad
"Room Terrible. Turns Out That The Room Was Private Owned And The Hotel Take Nothing To Do With This Particular Room. Room Had A Cleaning Bill To Be Paid On Arrival For The Room To Be Cleaned For After Your Stay But I Would Not Say That It Was NOT Even Cleaned Properly For Our Arrival Bath Was Disgustingly Dirty, Mould Round Bath Edges And A Random Used Bikini Hanging From Shower Terrible, A Lot Of Ants In Room Also",Bad

"Rooms at the back, ground floor, avoid!. Staff seemed a little moody to start. Didn't explain how the door to the block worked so we were left puzzled for a day. Power cut on day 1....no warning....electrical work being done which the electricians casually abandoned after 30 mins returning hours later)
No staff in the evening and my key stopped working on Christmas day. I was locked out; security guard eventually came to do rounds and let me into my room to get some things then I had to spend the night elsewhere as he couldn't help me with a new key card.
The room I had was on the ground floor at the back of the building.  It was put of the sun but rather cold and draughty.  IF YOU ARE OFFERED ROOMS 101-104 BE AWARE THST THERE IS ZERO SOUNDPROOFING!  You can literally hear everything from upstairs (furniture inexplicably dragged across the floor from 7am)and the adjoining rooms. One night was so bad that the guests next door were talking loudly at around 130am and it felt that they were actually  present in the room. Residents above their room were knocking to wall to get their attention (I.e. To shut up) to no avail. The following day, the neighbours were clearly heard blaming me for knocking on the wall and complaining ""We are on our holidays,  we are only talking, we don't complain when he has his music blaring out in the day; how dare he knock the wall....blah, blah"". The acoustics are so bad that you can hear a person 2 apartments away walking through their own apartment!  Every toilet noise is audible, a cough, sniff etc...  I was not happy; I would certainly not have knocked the wall, I would have asked them directly to be quiet; however, as I had the holiday ""runs"" at that moment, I could not leave the bathroom so I certainly was not bothered about next door's drunken rantings about Kilamanjaro and some woman one of them had slept with!",Bad

apartment and we noticed patio door and front door had previously been
broken into. Did not feel safe the first night we stayed as our
apartment was beside a public walkway. Apartment next door had front
door broken open two days after we arrived. Facilities are very basic
for holiday location, not many holiday makers around. Location is up
high and is not possible to walk to beach from here, take too long with
bags children etc. Cleaners do basic cleaning, I found food in the
microwave and noticed the bathroom floor had not been mopped out and
cleaned as there was a lot of hair and dust behind the door.

The bathroom smelled like a sewer that they tried to cover with air fresheners. The bedroom is agains the road and Kasbah, much traffic all night with cars honking all the time and yelling from the center. Dosent matter is the window is closed or opened you could hear a mosquito outside anyway, no isolation.",Bad
Stayed in better for less money. No plug in bathroom to charge electric razor or toothbrush. They try to charge for small things like valuables locker in the room and need to provide a deposit for a towel. This leaves a bad taste considering the amount you pay for the hotel. Also charging for the spa which was pretty small seemed over the top.,Bad
Sunset at balcony. nan,Bad
"Terrible Hotel. our room was filthy, I had to ask reception to have the public hairs from our bath it was disgusting.  The corners of the room were so dirty having never seen a mop. The worst thing was the filthy stained matteress witness no protecters. Stay away from this Hotel.",Bad
"Terrible hotel- not recommended!. Temperature in our room was 10 degrees when it was 19 degrees outside. The hotel doesn't have AC or heating so I ended up with a terrible cold. I'm still coughing my lungs out. When we were in the hotel restaurant more than half of the guests in the hotel were constantly coughing. Also, there is very loud singing every night until midnight and you can clearly hear music coming from other bars around as well as the people staying next door. so forget sleeping and privacy in this place.",Bad
"Terrible stay at Melia group hotel.. Recently taken over from Sol Hotels. Dirty, unmaintained rooms. Poor buffet food. No information in room re hotel or local area. Could not ring reception as no info re dialling. Very tatty 2* at best.",Bad
"The accommodation ruined the holiday.. The place was dire. I've never stayed in such a dilapidated room. The front door was about as secure as a rabbit hutch, none of the internal doors fitted, the beds were dated - uncomfortable & noisy, the sofa bed was broken, the kitchen was filthy, the fridge a health hazard, most wall lights had wires hanging out/exposed. 
There is a sign in the frequently closed reception area telling you there is a charge to move rooms. 
The block is partly owner occupied. It has more of a run down council estate feel than that of a holiday apartment complex.
The residents thing nothing of shouting between the apartments throughout the night and when they stop their dogs take over. 
Sometimes at night the communal areas are quite scary - groups of people (don't appear to be holiday makers) congregate there and deliberately make it difficult for you to walk through. There wasn't any noticeable security or cameras in these areas when I was there.",Bad

"The availability of a supermarket close to the resort. 16€ / person for a 4 day internet connection is expensive. It is even less justified when this connection doesn't work inside of the appartment, and that you have to stay outside to get a minimum of signal. In addition, there were animations everynight close to the swimming pool, which is probably highly appreciated by families. But as a group of friends, we would have appreciated to enjoy time on our terrace without the 300 decibels of the animation music and children games. There were clearly not enough material in the appartment to cook properly, it was almost like doing camping.",Bad

"the hotel was clean. our room overlooked the pool and bar usually this would be great however as the hotel has no air-conditioning and therefore we had to sleep with our balcony door open.  The problem with this was that obviously we couldn't get to sleep until everybody else went to bed as we could here the music and the people out drinking.
for the first few nights I didn't let this bother me as of course people are on holiday and want to stay up late and enjoy themselves however this became such an issue where I had to tell people to be quite. the bar stops serving the all inclusive drinks at 11pm however is open till midnight and ofcourse people were still drinking till early hours in the morning... 
you might say oh well ur on holiday u can have a lay in..... this is not the case as you have to get up early to make sure you get a decent sunbed as its very cramped around the pool so had to set an alarm for 6am to get one... then once u was up that was it as at 10.30am the music starts again so u cant have a nap through the day... another thing is there isn't enough tables for people to sit at when at the pool bar so in the evening people had to sit on sunbeds!!!! 
the food... the breakfast was probably the best meal all the other meals were the same everyday may different in sauces some times but that is it...
I am surprised at how some people have given this hotel a raving review as having the experience ive had makes me wonder if people are wrighting about the same hotel..
the reception staff were the worst no organisation... no urgency in anything you could be stood there for 20 minutes but they will serve someone else!!!!

The only thing I liked about this hotel was the size of the.... This is not a four star hotel. We booked for one night thinking we would have a nice meal in the restaurant. It was horrendous. An all inclusive bun fight on plastic chairs. Couldn't even get a decent drink. Pay 2 euros and help yourself to a pump on the side. Food quantity over quality. Beds so hard I thought I was sleeping on an ironing board. Walls so thin I knew when several rooms were using the toilet. There are some lovely four star hotels in Puerto de la cruz.

"The pool was big.. The policy of paying for the accomodation by cash only is not only
strange but inconvenient. We arrived late on arrival and did not have
650 euro in cash to pay, the man in reception said pay whenever in the
week. Midway during our week he arrived at the door in an aggressive
manner ordering us to pay our bills. His manner was unacceptable and
rude. The cleaning staff were appauling. Our room wasn't properly
cleaned once in the week. They gave clean towels and toilet
paper..nothing else. The floors were obviously dirty from sandy shoes
etc and were never cleaned. On the day we were due to leave a cleaning
lady just came into our room without ringing the bell. I was just out of
the shower. She started shouting at me saying get out room finished. I
said calmly that we were checking out shortly and she proceeded to shout
in an aggressive manner saying get out now before slamming the door
behind her. I was just appauled at this behaviour. 2 minutes later the
rude man from reception was banging on the door asking why I was
refusing to leave the room. I told him how rude that staff member was to
me...no apology. Checkout was at 12 and this happened at exactly 12.01.
When I go on holiday I like hospitality and staff that are
friendly....it scored zero in this respect. It was also a very noisy
place at all times of the day and night. The beds were awful...2 Single
beds, rock hard that kept seperating and the sheets weren't changed
once. We stayed in a place in Lanzarotte last April that was half the
price and it was cleaned daily and quiet. Bigger price tag doesn't
always mean better is what we learned.

Very disappointed and won't be returning. We found the receptionist very unhelpful and rarely smiled.

There were children staying there at the time which must have been scary for them!! As it was our last weekend it was a bit disappointing and also the pool which had been crystal clear before was left very cloudy and you couldn't actually see the bottom needless to say we didn't dare enter it to have a final swim.,Bad

comfortable place inside outside the apartment was ok but these places
need a lot of work doing to them I think for what we paid it should have

"very poor holiday resource. this is very clearly a dilapidated holiday resource, severely lacking in investment and refurbishment since the 70s. 
It shouldn't be rated any more than two stars. I never felt safe in the hotel given it's poor attention to health and safety, ie, getting trapped on the balcony when the door isn't able to be opened from the outside.
I would think twice from here on in with using booking. com",Bad
"Very Poor Hotel i shall never return. rude staff, poor food, poor all inclusive, poor value for money, the worst 4 start hotel i have ever stayed at",Bad
Very poor value for money and not as expectef. Our room was in the depths of the hotel dirty and dingy with lots of cockroaches. Very inefficient air con. All sun beds reserved early in the morning so not easy to find a comfy place to sit outside.,Bad
"Very poor value for mony. Very poor value for money. Extremely tired facilities and access to the lower road was like going through a 1960s prison tunnel. This hotel certainly does not deserve its 5 star ranking. A broken fridge door, formica and plywood with dark corridors are not in any way luxury qualities.",Bad
"Very Poor, tired and dirty. Cleaniless, filthy place, everywhere stunk of cigarette smoke, the walls are so thin you can hear every noise from someone going to the loo and doors banging throughout night! Beds are so uncomfortable you are better off sleeping on concrete-springs everywhere! And everything is so dated and tired, the whole place needs a very good revamp! I wasn't expecting much for the price I paid but this was awful!",Bad
"Very Shabby. Cleaning
Room standard
Broken Kitchen units
Bad lighting in the food area",Bad
"Very shabby, lifeless room, disappointed that it professed to a four star rating.. Room was very shabby, the ceiling was coming away in a number of areas, very dated overall, no coffee or tea making facilities, so disappointed that we decided not to stay there for the next night even though we had paid for it.",Bad
"Very suspicious of the high reviews for this place - avoid. Staff were rude and dismissive for even minor politely made requests (eg there are no tables cleaned, is it possible to have one cleared?)
Extra charges for ridiculous things like the safe, 'hiring' the empty minibar fridge etc. Unbelievable really when you consider what you are paying per night.
Inclusive food fine but samey so we only bothered with it the first two nights.
Lots of other silly things like the sunbeds all 'reserved' with towels even with people MIA for 2 hours etc that just grind on you when you are already having a bad time.",Bad

WARNING. The lift has long term ongoing problems.. We were on the 1st floor and with the lift broken it was almost 100 steps to climb. For those on floor 5  it was a nightmare with hundreds of steps. I gather from the staff that this is a long term ongoing problem. This was a real deal breaker for us and I would not return and I would not recommend this place. A pity as otherwise it would have been a pleasant holiday.,Bad
Was AT this hostel because There was Nothing else available.. Everything,Bad
"We are looking for an alternative hotel. All the alterations to this hotel as ruined the appeal,the public areas are austere to say the least!. The lounge is like an airport lounge,and the dinning room is like eating in a garage.",Bad

The maids did not clean the rooms.

"WiFi is flaky, AC isn't working. Expensive parking, even after ""discount"", air conditioner was hardly working, the room temperature was the same with it on or off.

"Worst hotel experience!!!. No air con, far too loud on a night kids/teens running round all over hotel at midnight and beyond no respect for anybody trying to sleep at night, dated decor in need desperately of a refurb, basic old furniture, maid service every other day and no regular bed changes, nobody on reception at night from about 6pm onwards, couldn't get in the pool or a lounger for overcrowding by all the locals staying there...pool is far too small.
The only nice part of the whole experience is that the staff were friendly...
Would not recommend this hotel to family's at all or couples looking for a relaxing holiday only ideal for stag/hen do!! The noise from the commercial centres pubs and clubs go on til 6 in the morning!next door Spanish young lads coming back at early dawn every morning trying to get in their apartment banging the door down 😑

Room never cleaned and the one time it was cleaned they didn't even change the sheets.",Bad
Would not recommand this hotel to anyone. Hotel is stuck in the 70s and needs a complete over hall. Rooms very outdated and uncomferable,Bad
"Would not recommend. Apartments were very worn out and tired. Everything needed to be replaced. Kitchen was badly equipped, no microwave, no chopping board, chopping knives, wine glasses. Had fruit bowl, small glasses, water jug, one pot, citrus juicer and small cups.

Wouldn't stay there again!. Hardly ever anybody on reception. Bad wifi. Very dark and some lights didn't work. Kitchen light kept going off.,Bad

"False advertisement. Booked online full board and there was mention of drinks not being included on the website  very disappointed when come down for meal and told to pay for drinks,we think this is fauls advertisement and would of booked somewhere else  consisting it was unfair",Bad
Friendly staff.. The food was basic and not much to choose from,Bad
"Honest review. Very dated with lack of attention to detail. No Air con or fan. Most basic apartment I've ever stayed in, had to buy own T towels. Lack of shade in pool area , thatched umbrellas threadbare. Please read my trip advisor when posted as there is not enough space here",Bad
"No cleaning included. There was no information from booking.com or the hotel that this hotel does not include cleaning.
In 3 weeks time we got new towels 1 time/week and not once bed sheets were changed and 6 toilet rolls for 3 weeks. Cleaning had to be done by yourself. It was hard to get information the few times someone was in the reception, even though the people were nice. The information said there would be a microoven and a boiler, but there was not. In general, not clean and hard to keep clean.",Bad
"Old, worn and tired looking facilities in a central location.. Kitchen facilities very limited & worn. Furnishings old, worn and tired. Building itself is old, worn and tired.",Bad
Oldfashioned and tired decor. Depressing and overpriced.. Distance from beach and shops,Bad
"Staff easily contactable - pool looked clean and reasonable.... Lots of broken things including toilet - (which was fixed quite quickly) but chair broken, light fitting broken, stove not working fully, curtains not covering window properly, bed supported by coffee tables - also could have been cleaner - pans all grubby sheets on bed although looked clean had hairs on them - not the sort of standard I would expect for this price in Europe.",Bad
The sea water swimming pool.. The apartment was awful. Light fitting falling off the ceiling. 2 gas ring burner that didn't work. The whole apartment and balcony needed totally refurbishing. The disco noise in the bedroom going on till the early hours of the morning. Literally the worst apartment I have ever stopped in and at 52 euro a night a total rip off.,Bad
"Think you can get better.. The appartments could have been cleaner. The bathroom had mould all around the shower, towels & Sheets where never changed. We had to buy our own toilet rolls, there were no complementary toiletries as stated on there website. The reseptionist was very rude, always on the phone when ever I went there, she just ignored us.",Bad

Total darkness, no window- only a kind of external door with very small tile of technical opaque glass, broken door to the toilet, broken lamp. After the claim we've heard that we should have booked a room with a balcony. We got anther room with working door to the toleit and lamp but even darker, with broken fridge and door shared with another room, through which we have heard everything, as if we were in the common room with our neighbors. That's the San Antonio's 4* conditions and service... That was real disaster. The worst conditions we've ever had at ANY hotel in our life...",Bad
"Very good location, the rest is ok. the place was very very small but I guess ok for just sleeping at night. Cannot hang out in the hostel",Bad
"- The pool area - nice pool and clean area to sunbathe.. - Reception staff - bad service - not very friendly and aren't particularly approachable/willing to help(two men).
- PAY box TV...$1 an hour ..not much but very outdated and little channels.
-Biggest issue was TINY HOT WATER TANK, only one person can shower for 5 minutes before it runs out of hot water and you have to reset the boiler. Very inconvenient. No bath facility (taps). 
- Location - hotel was set up on a hill, this could be problematic for some, I'm pretty fit so wasn't a problem for me. They do offer a free bus which you catch from the hotel round the corner, we never used.
- Plug wire hanging out of walls - dangerous.
- Generally, the accommodation was out dated but spacious.",Bad
"-nice living room and kitchen. -beach is realy far away
-you have to pay for everything (Web, kettle, iron)",Bad
...... Sound insulation was terrible and we could hear the traffic vey loudly....not good for sleeping. Apartment was quite run down. There was a TV available with a slot for payment at 1euro an hour. For the price we paid I expected more.....,Bad
"2 days without water. We were without water for two days, because owner of the appartment didn't pay water bill.",Bad
"3 weeks of discomfort means we won't return, and the price we paid
was nothing short of robbery
. 1.The description of the property was sadly misleading, as several
  features were not to be found, E.G. adequate catering items.
2.The kitchen itself is ancient, with ants who seem to live in the many cracks where the beading was removed to accommodate the refrigerator. Really shoddy.
3. The bathroom had NO BATH, a shower had been installed. This is a potential threat to anyone who slips in it as it didn't have any handrails, DANGEROUS !!
4. The 'sofa bed' was not at all comfortable to use as a sofa. Indeed, there was NO comfortable seating inside the apartment, especially re the flimsy loose toilet seat.
5. The 2 beds that we used were simply not comfortable either. There were 5 coat hangers and inadequate wardrobe space. God help them if 4 people book this place !
6. Oh, and the lighting was very poor . . .

"4 stars?. Very disappointed from a 4 star hotel.
The place is nice and clean (it is very new) but I didn't feel like been in a 4 star wellness hotel.
When I arrived after few minutes I went to the bar to have a drink, the chef made me a nice drink, but it was not a relaxing experience because the manager, I suppose, was training one member of the staff and it was not doing it in a quiet way, it was a very annoying situation.
The bar counter was not so clean for a 4 stars hotel.
The room was nice but a huge with luck for details and more:
-The toilette did not have any brush
- No hairdryer in the room
- the air conditioning was right on the top of the bad
- the toilette or the shower did not have any ventilation.
- almost no informations were in the room about the ""wellness"" facility
- the ""not disturb"" sign was made of paper and since the rooms are bungalows the wind made the sign fly away so I was disturbed 4 times in 1 hour... the others days I sticked the sign inside the glass door with tape
- there is no control of the bar bill, they were about to charge me for things I didn't drink but after 2 bills finally I got the right one.
- I hade breakfast and I decided to eat just a croissant with jam, well the croissant was a mix between bread and a croissant, it was served with a huge piece of butter, I would expected much better presentation from a 4 star hotel
- the TV in the room had just few Spanish speaking channels
- the room was equipped with a cattle, coffee and teas but the power cord for the cattle was so short that did not reach the socket unless the cattle was on the floor
- no paper or pen in the room
- my phone 4G connection was better then the internet in the room
- there was only 1 hanger for the towels and far from the shower...
The place is gorgeous, not in the best location, the staff is quite nice but the service is not nice, it feels like an amateur decided to open a 4 stars hotel...",Bad
5 minutes walking from the beach. We came in tye appartment and it was very dirty. Inside the appartments there were too many stairs and it was very confusing. The parking is on the back side not really accessible,Bad
70's hotel. hotel was stuck in the 1970's,Bad
"A DISASTER OF A PLACE. I hated nearly everything about this place no baby pool, no wifi, staff were very rude NO AIR CONDITIONING you had to pay €40 to rent a fan no remotrol control with the TV you had to pay €20 would never stay there again I would not advise anyone to stay here",Bad
"A hotel for older people with plenty of disadvantages but one big advantage - super tasty food. Cleaning ladies never seem to do the best of them: shower corner and the floor remained the same dirty as before the cleaning, cleaning staff either entered the room while we were sleeping in the morning or did their job after 2 o'clock in the afternoon. During our 1 week stay they did not change our bed sheets at all.  When we asked for an iron at the reception desk, we were told that an iron costs 2 EUR per day and we need to pay also 10 EUR deposit for it!!! Later we discovered that many other normal services are not free for their guests, such as a safe, a tolarable WIFI, even a minibar!!! Free Internet was a disaster, we waited ages to open the disarable website. I am talking about 4 star hotel!!! Hotel doesn't provide its guests with bathrobes, sleepers, tea making facilties as many other 4 star hotel do.. The most disappointing fact was that we booked our room 7 month before our stay and we kindly asked for the upper room but when we checked in they gave as a room on the 1st floor with a parking view. What a warm welcome, huh? The hotel is full of older people, who watched at us in our thirties as if we were aliens. The overall impression was that hotel was trying to make as much money on its guest as possible. The hotel uses the cheapest Chinese soap, they give only 5 towels for 2 people, 2 big ones only, the rest are the napkin size. Be sure if you don't drop the towels onto the floor the cleaners won't change them!!! I will not come back to this hotel although the food was just perfect. I think I better pay more for another hotel but I will enjoy every second of my stay..",Bad
"A lot of money for the service we got. The whole building is white inside and out , no pictures on the walls, it's like a hospital. The breakfast was in the basement and it was cold all week. We had to get three lifts to get to reception. I asked for a bucket of ice one of the days and they wanted to charge me . Our suite got no sun all day either.",Bad
"A somewhat rundown room, with a number of defects that were real problems, and no staff available.. The room was in bad condition. It had a strange smell. The toilet was not connected to the floor. The shower head exploded off when the water was turned on and could not be replaced. The only fluorescent light in the bathroom was flickering and there was no way to get it replaced, as the owner of the ""hotel"" does not reside in the Giraflor apartment complex in which it is located. Everything was a bit shabby and rundown in the room. The reception had nothing to do with the hotel:  they said they would send the owner an email indicating what the room problems were, but I have not idea if they did this. As a guest you are really on your own here.",Bad
"A total rip off. I thought my bill for the week was €1085 for the week but my bill was £1485 when I queried this I was told the rate changed daily !! I will not be returning to Diamond resorts I feel I have been completely ripped off 
I was also told I had to  pay for towels on top of this !!",Bad
"A very well located hotel with 3* facilities and 2* services. Wifi does not work appropriately
Parking was not included which is strange for 4*

Our toilet paper finished in the first day and never re-filled!!",Bad
"差评. not a 4 star ,not even 3",Bad
"Absolute nightmare!!!!!. Room cleaned only 3 times in 14 days, only changed bedding once, had to keep asking for fresh towels.     Our TV was removed as the tenants lease was up for renewal and they were leaving so wanted to take all tv's from rooms.     Low moral amongst staff as the hotel was closing down on 28th September, the day we were due to leave.    We were told we could use hotel until we were due to leave at 4.00pm only to find that our key card would no longer work and we couldn't get into our room to collect our belongings, all phone numbers had been removed from the gate and all staff had left.    We had to obtain emergency number from sister hotel, got our stuff with only 10 minutes to spare before taxi arrived.",Bad
"Accommodation was terrible.. Accommodation was terrible.
Air conditioning was from 80's and it was not working at all.
Room equipment was very old.",Bad
"Amazing view but dissapointing condition of building/roos. The price is way too high for the offered quality of the rooms. Despite having booked a superior room I the quality was disappointing, old furnigure, refurbishment done very lausy and building really old. After asking for cancellation of the reservation the receptionist offered me the money back which really surprised me. Very friendly staff.",Bad
"An excellent holiday alround, Appartment very clean, the daily water aerobics was great fun.. No Complaints at all",Bad
"Ants everywhere: YES; wifi coverage: NO!. Internet: the internet was slow, the connection often broke, and there were no coverage in the bedroom, so I had to sit in the livingroom whenever I wanted to check my messages. Awful!
Cleanness: there were ants everywhere. Literally everywhere. In the kitchen, in the bathroom, even in my bed. The cleaning lady brought poison, that smelled like hell, and could not use the kitchen for hours, and the other day there were lots of ants again.
I told the stuff that I am having these complaints and advised me talk to their boss. I wanted compensation as these facts really spoiled my stay. Their boss had no time to talk to me, but said that the wifi will be mended (which does not mean anything to me as during my stay it did not run properly, so I had not been able to use what I paid for) and said that one has either ants or cockroaches. So maybe I should be happy that I slept with ants and not with cockroaches?!?!
Well, for this price I expected a way better stay. My friends stayed at the hotels near yumbo, almost for this price, where you are not obliged to take their car service from the airport because the reception closes at 19.00, and where there is at least a bar of soap in the bathroom.
The location is very good, the staff is friendly, but altogether it was a disappointing stay. I loved Gran Canaria, but I would not chose this place again (maybe for half price), and will not recommend to anyone.",Bad
"Apartment is OK, with two large bedrooms.. The cleaning was very, very bad! Tried to ask the staff for better cleaning, but nothing happened.",Bad
"Apartment was nice and simple.. The most rude and unhelpful staff I ever see in the property like this.
The reception was quiet far, the first day the elevator was not working.
Cleaning lady was not cleaning out toilet or generally our apartment for all 6 days ( only bed ) even if the information provided was that the house keeping is coming every days except Thu/Sun. The small soap which was provide we supposed to have for all stay. Even after the request if possible to clean out bathroom and provide the soap in the end of the day we just found 5 package of shampoos on the sink but again nobody even touch the surface of the bathroom and no Soap provided. After calling again the reception they advised me that we get the shampoo so everything is ok. The cleaning lady didnt appear again. Wifi was NOT working at all even at reception - connection for few minutes, the man on the front desk advised we may buy a Wi-fi but before we have 15 min free to see the connection. After unsuccessful try to connect we called to reception to advised us how to use this 15 min for free. The employee just said to wait left me on phone for 4 min speaking with other person. Then he just told me we need to pay, very rude behavior. After long discussion he lead me how to get connect to get out 15min to be able to see the strong of the connection before we pay 6EUR/day.
The staff on the dinning room was as well horrible. Not wish to help with anything and very rude in speech as well. Once I took the napkins from the other table next to us, the lady who prepared the table give me the look and told me that I can not take it like this. I advised they were not napkins provide on our table. She advised me to go and get them by my self. Very unprofessional. After the dinner we order a coffee at bar ( Coffee machine from the breakfast for 1.50 EUR, no fresh coffee in whole hotel ) My boyfriend ask also for glass of tap water. The bartender told him that he will not provide any water and we need to buy it.

Average and dated. Pool and reception area.  Also entrance to hotel was on a sloped driveway - not very attractive.,Bad
"Average hotel, but very overpriced.. Some of the staff were very helpful, the majority particularly in the dining room were not.",Bad
"Avoid at all cost!!. Terrible experience. Reception not always open. No reception upon arrival. OK was able to phone a number to contact staff, but surely in this day and age that is poor business.
A man (although not well and on a long term lease in a private appartment at the Europa) totally ruined the holiday for me and a number of people who I spoke to who were also staying at the Europa. He kept playing the same recorded speech 'very, very, VERY loudly' over and over and over again (I could hear the noise over 9 appartments away and that was with the balcony door and bedroom door closed)!! so noisey it would awaken me despite all doors closed and a distance away. This resulted in 1) not being able to use the pool as it was extremely noisey with the same highly irritating noise. I could not sit out in the balsony in enjoyment for the same reason. I have never in over 30 years on going on Holidays experience such annoyance. The pool and the balconies were empty (surely this should alert the staff that guest were so unhappy). Also there were numerous complainys yet nothing sorted.
I accept the man is unwell and his behavour is beyond his control (therefore I do not blame him), however...
...Surely as a matter of courtesy and professionalism, management should have pre-warned customers of this situation prior to their arrival, so that they could review their booking and change to another complex should they wish. A serious demonstration of inept management and lack of concern for guests to at least try to have a decent holiday. Remember this man is on a long term lease and many over guests are going to have their holiday ruined!!",Bad

Bad value for money. Very noisy for night life across the  road . No comments on booking about this. No air conditioning so couldn't sleep. Not enough chairs for guests in appartments.  Staff not often there .,Bad
BalconyDebacle. TV didn't work despite 10 euro rental deposit. Advertised balcony  appalling and unusable as it looked on to internal passageway to main dining room consequently there was noise around the clock.,Bad
Basic accomodation for a cheap price. The instalations are very poor and not enough confortable. Noisy. The staff not very friendly (a big difference with the rest of People in the Island). In the end it is ok for this price.,Bad

"Be Cool was not so Cool. This review is about the Be Cool Resort. Number 4 is by far the smallest bungalow. I spoke to the owner who promissed me a change of rooms, nothing happened. The welcoming was very poor. 
In the bungalow is no information available e.g. who to call in case of emergency. Could be usefull/necessary as this resort is a seperated place.
No one came to see me when I was about to leave. You don't feel treated as a (honoured) guest at all.
The bathroom looks old, small and not well maintained. 
The promissed bathrobe (see description of the junior suite on website) was not available. 
The change of sheets was very poor although the nights were warm and sweaty (no airco).
The equipment in the kitchen is very limited and no cleaning material was available.",Bad

Moved to a studio as another junior suite not available. 203 Not air conditioned but fresh air was supposedly operated by a switch that was not working we were told. Was supposed to be a 2 day treat for us. It put a ""downer"" on the whole 2 days. Received a 6.75€ discount per day, for the two days in a studio compared to a junior suite. Though how that was worked out I don't know if you check the hotels own website for prices.",Bad
"Been to Gran Canaria many times.. The fact that the property was in the shade for most of the day.
The rising damp in the bedroom and probably associated with the damp was all the black mites found on the kitchen surfaces and on the curtains in the bedroom and lounge.

"Cockroaches. After 5 days, we discovered a hugh cockroach in the bathroom. We asked a solution to the Reception, so we moved to another room (1/2 days of holiday lost) & after 2 days in this second room we found again a cockroach in the apartment with a spray again cockroach in the kitchen! We were not able to spleep anymore as we were afraid that the cockroach was next to us! We informed the receptionnist upon check-out, no discount offered, they are use of this comment. They said ""we are in a tropical area""! Coakroach are due to dirtiness & not only due to weather!
If you book sea view, you will have all the noise of the bars under the hotel till 02:00 am. They have made a big renovation of the swimming area but if you spend holidays with cockroach you will never come back or recommand this hotel!!!
The cleaners do not have trolley, so they left clean sheets & towels in the flowers & plants.
They should close the hotel the time to find a good treatment against cockroach & clean more often the area with the rubbish bins!",Bad
"Cold showers, no sun and loud music til late at night :-(. The shower ran hot for about 3mins then went cold regardless of time of day so I was always washing shampoo out of my hair with cold water.

"Could be a lot better. Apartment had no air conditioning. The beds were very uncomfortable and none of the bedding matched, even in the same room. Bedding was threadbare and needs replacing. Cupboards were full of owners goods including building materials. The towels were worn and the white ones had obviously been washed with the red ones as they had pink patches all over them. There was no oven or toaster so could only cook on two rings.",Bad
"Dated and over priced.. Alborada Beach Club 
How to start!! “Kiss me quick hats and candyfloss” just about sums it up. The rooms are very tired, paint peeling, and chipped around doorways the decoration is very dated, and dull. A lot of the privately owned apartments are for sale, which in itself tells a story.
The pool is sea water, so bear that in mind if you have young children, it’s not so good for them to play in all day. Occasionally the sea will breach the wall and the swimming pool will come to you rather than you going to it!
DO NOT BOOK THIS AS HOTEL ONLY!!! I booked hotel only as I had business to attend to the following week. I was expecting a  good quality hotel at €509.76 for 4 nights. Through booking.com. I met people that had paid £337.00 each for a full week, room, flights, transfers, and all inclusive. I had room only! The hotel blamed Booking .com so maybe they should be avoided if that is true?
Restaurant for breakfast, as a non all inclusive guest I was charged 6.00 Euros for a very sub standard meal. The fried eggs were cooked so hot that they were brown and burnt around the edges and had a hard burnt base. The bacon was a re-constituted meat product; God only knows what they were made of. Hey on a positive note the oranges were lovely, I guess they didn’t have anything to do with them. After the first bad experience, I went to the sea front and had a perfectly acceptable full English breakfast, with juice and coffee, for 3.50 Euros! 
I personally found the front desk staff sultry, and not really interested. The bar staff worked hard and deserve some praise for dealing with the amount of customers they have each evening.  The top marks however go to housekeeping. Good job all round.",Bad

Definately a budget apartment. Lack of wifi - Expensive and only available in reception! Facilities very basic for rating. Very noisy. Loud music (singing) at night.,Bad
"Definitely not recommend. Awful meal; loud music every night from pool bar & from nearby hotels; uncomfortable hotel's territory; very uncomfortable bathroom in the rooms; uncomfortable beds.
Room cleaning service is annoying and moving/touching our stuff.

All additional service is ONLY for additional payment (it's weird for ""luxury"" hotel, as they call themselves).",Bad

Weekends you could not get a sun bed.
Supermarket was not stocked well and we could never get fresh milk there. It closed at 2pm which was crazy for a holiday complex.
Lots of work going on, painting of apartments.
I would not go back to these apartments.",Bad
"Disappointed!!!. All the amenities cost extra, which is not stated on Booking.com
The spa area - which was the sole reason we booked this hotel - was closed due to the Easter holiday! How a resort - where people travel on holiday to spend their vacation - can close down their number one selling point due to ""holiday"" is beyond me. At least, this should have been stated upon making the (non-refundable) reservation - and they should also have sublet the rooms at a major discount. We felt cheated and the personnel didn't seem to bother.
The tennis court was only available a few hours each day since they didn't want people playing during meal hours. So we didn't get to play at all...
The breakfast buffet was heavily meat-oriented and not very appealing for healthy vegetarians. The bread was fresh and tasty though. Too bad we didn't get to enjoy our sandwiches; the kitchen staff started cleaning up extremely loud twenty minutes prior to closing time - rude!",Bad
"Disappointing. Was not what was supposed to be included in the apartment, soap and shampoo was not, and toilet paper was not enough of the period.
Very bad drains smell was in the bathroom at night, the front desk could not do anything about it despite the complaints. Would get another apartment, but it was not possible.",Bad
"Disappointing stay in shoddy apartments with very basic facilities. General maintenance standards in the flats

"Disappointing Stay Redeemed By Good Customer Relations. So very disappointing.
Unfortunately on checkin we were informed that the newly renovated 'Superior Apartment' we had reserved was not complete because renovation work was behind schedule.
The rate we paid was reduced to reflect this and we were charged for a standard grade apartment.
My dissatisfaction was, we were not informed BEFORE arrival, that the accommodation we 'had' booked was possibly not going to be avaialble, allowing us the opportunity to make alternative arrangements, if we thought necessary.
In the Travel Industry, this is known as providing 'Errata' information, and is a legal requirement, by the hotel or agent, prior to travel. It wasn't provided.
Our only choice was to be accommodated in an old standard apartment which was tired and dated - old beds and furniture, with very poor lighting.
The first one we were given was on the ground floor, no view, dark with a smell of damp and unsuitable.
Reception were apologetic and as accommodating as they could be.
We moved to a first floor property (517) which had an acceptable view, but still a million miles away from what we had booked & certainly not what had been anticipated.
Lighting in this room was still poor, rooms were not well aired & smelled damp. It was old and dated & very disappointing, albeit better than the first one.
The safe was inadequate, too small and it sat in the bottom of the wardrobe - you could pick it up and take it away. Not good enough in this current climate of heightened security measures.
WIFI was poor and only free if you sat in Reception - in my opinion and in this day and age, WIFI is essential everywhere and should be inclusive. Just another excuse to make extra money, however, even paying extra didn't provide a good signal.",Bad
"Disappointing, hotel in need of a complete re-fit. Not 4*.. Hotel is very dated - didn't smell great either. I've stayed in 3* apartments in Tenerife that have been much better and much cheaper. Was pretty disappointed.",Bad

Leaky bath/shower
No view from balcony - was told city view or pool view when booking on website",Bad
Disappointment.. Pool is small and not suitable for children.  Pictures are misleading.  There is no recreation.  The bed was horrible to say the least.  No coffee maker in the room.  Hard to find because there is no sign in the street.,Bad
Dissapointing. Need of refurbishment,Bad
"Dissapointment. We got very badly furnished room - more or less it was juat bed and two small bad tables with a view to a swimming floor in the first floor. The pictures on booking are non-relyable to most of the rooms. We had ask for impeovement and at last got better room, but for extra 10 €.  I am not saying it is a lot of money, bit I really did not like the approach - give you lowest standard we have and wait whether you will complain or not. It is not such fun for the money they charge.",Bad
"Distressing, disruptive and in no way  the relaxing week we had planned.. I was travelling with my elderly grandmother who struggles to walk long distances. We had booked all inclusive with the intention that we would spend the majority of our time in the complex reducing the amount of walking my grandmother would need to do. We also took my grandmothers wheelchair so in the event we chose to leave the complex for a day trip my grandmother would have support for her mobility. When we checked in at the agreed time in the afternoon we had been travelling since 5.30am and were keen to both check in to our apartment and to also have something to eat. We were disappointed to find that between the hours of 2.30pm - 6.00pm there was no facility within the complex to access food as the restaurant was closed and there are no snack bars, given that the booking was all inclusive and the check in time imposed by the organization it was not helpful to find that we immediately had to leave the complex to find something to eat. The following  morning we were awoken by a considerable amount of noise coming from the pool area below our balcony. On investigation I discovered that workmen were breaking up concrete along the pool footpath, this work continued throughout the week of our stay and went on throughout each day. the noise was impossible to ignore and unfortunately meant that we had to leave the complex every day in order to try to get some peace. As a result this meant we were not able to access the all inclusive facilities we had booked and paid for, it also meant that I spent a much greater percentage of my week having to take my grandmother out in her wheelchair which again did not make for a relaxing week away as we had planned. much of the pool was cordoned off for the largest part of the week in on one of the days the pool was completely drained making it totally inaccessible. Whilst the trip was in January the temperature were high and being able to access a pool was an important consideration when we made our booking.",Bad
"Don't expect a balcony. I'm used to budget accommodation but I have never written such a poor review as this.The blurb for this ""hotel"" is very misleading. It suggests that there is a balcony for every room. If you count a fence-like structure attached to the window to be a balcony then this is true. The wifi connection was very poor and kept disconnecting. When I spoke to the owner about this and asked  for another room, he refused and told me that I should move around the room to get a connection. The flush on my toilet did not work properly. It was finally fixed properly the day before I was due to leave. I had been there for 8 nights. Nuff said.",Bad
"Don't go there, unless You're a party animal.. My towel hasn't been changed for the whole week. There was no soap. Random people were coming to our room to use the toilet, even late at night. Rubbish internet. Found a cockroach in the bathroom. Staff was smoking weed and sleeping in the lounge. Not enough room for the luggage.",Bad
"Dont stay there. The most un-comfortable beds I've ever sleep in. Shower head holder hanging, no plugs for plughole.  Tatty décor. Pillows atrocious...",Bad
Dreadful experience - lots of issues. Dreadful experience. Paid 430 Euros for two nights stay half board. Arrived at 3.00 and had to wait 1 ½ hrs to get room. Told would have upgrade. Room had smallest balcony in the (very large) hotel. No key for safe – informed this required additional 10 Euro deposit. No glasses in bedroom – informed you can only have paper cups! Evening meal – fiasco. Hotel overbooked and ½ hr queue to get into canteen style dining room. No wine service. This hotel has so many complaints it even has desk by reception with 2-3 persons dealing with issues (but not resolving them). Requested formal complaint form – initially told they had none (Spanish law requires this!). After ½ hrs argument form finally arrived. Having completed form management offered a 50% refund which would be credited on departure. Leaving the following day – the credit had not been placed on the account. This took a further ¾ hour to resolve. Would not recommend and have made second complaint.,Bad
dreadful place. The food was aweful with hardly any choice and always barely warm. Breakfast was the best meal but even that was not great as the bacon was only just cooked through and the beans had a funny taste. At lunchtime there were always lots of flies on the food - very unhygienic.,Bad
Drilling and banging!. The refurbishments next door. I was not advised that this would be taking place-staff did not seem to be aware either.  The customer service was poor given my experience. I was told I should have waited in the que to change my room on such a short holiday.   I eventually got a days refund (5 days 3 days drilling and banging from 8 am -8pm dust everywhere) by default and was warned if I didn't make the rest of payment legal action would be taken.. I was very sad about this experience.  However still had an enjoyable experience whilst out.  It was a disappointment to say the least that I had to fight for compensation for my experience.,Bad
"Dull, depressing, outdated hotel, with basic facilities.. The hotel was obviously very fashionable when it was built, allot of thought was put into making it stand out, and have a particular gothic look.
Unfortunately, that was perhaps around 40 years ago, and nothing has been obviously updated since then, the décor is dark, dingy, outdated, and very worn. The beds do not look, or feel like they have ever been changed!
The Rey Carlos now only seems to attract, budget conscious, long term German, and Scandinavian, retired, residents, who wan to sit by the pool all day, and queue for the restaurant, waiting for the buffets to open.
The hotel has the feel that it is being run on a shoestring, from the multi tasking, unimpressed staff, to the cheap, basic toiletries in the bathroom, to the canteen like food that is on offer. Kitchen equipment consists of a fridge, three sets of plates, cups, cutlery, one small saucepan, and a coffee filter, with pot.
 I made the mistake of booking half board, as I thought it would save me thinking about where to eat, but what a mistake, and waste of money. The dinner buffet was very basic, unappetising and unimaginative. One night, it consisted of tinned sardines, and Russian salad for starters, deep fried fish, boiled broccoli, and mashed potato with some other greasy pasta options, for main course, and the usual melon, or fluorescent, tray baked sponge cake for desert. I gave it a couple of chances, on different nights, but ended up cooking for myself, or eating out. To say it was poor quality, would be an understatement.
Restaurant staff were unimpressed when you declined to buy extra drinks to go with your 'food'.
The hotel is between the Cita mall, and one of the resorts main roads, so not a quiet location, especially at the roadside pool. The bedroom window is onto the main corridor, with louvered windows, so you can here every noise, from other residents, to the cleaners, shouting to each other in the mornings.",Bad

"good location horrable service and insects in room. To be honest it was nightmare. Our issues with booking that we miss because or flight delay was totally ignored . I call few time to hotel to explain that we get delay but they just ignore it and we spend one night in super small room with broken shower and water in room because of broken pipe in air condition.
Main answer 'it is not our failure ask you tour operator'
Personal just lay that they are manages but on practise they dont  .
we get compensation room with sea view instead of normal one at the end but is is not the end of story !
One evening we find cockroach (cucaracha/ tarakan) wired insect in our room . Again we just get ignored . We get option to use poison inside our room with out temporary room and die together with insect or have cleaning and poison next day. We spend one night 'hanting ' insect . It was tru safari. 
I have super brave girlfriend

"Home from home, and not in a good way. After trailing around for 2 hours trying to find this apartment ~which absolutely no one knew the location of~, even with a map and full address, (and being robbed of 35€ from a taxi driver) we finally found the apartment and met a resident who was able to contact our key holder and get her to come to the apartment, oh yeah... If you have an English phone don't bother trying to call the number on all of the documents because it will tell you it doesn't exist. Anyway, we finally got into the apartment and after all of that we each just wanted to take a nice shower and relax, I jumped in first while my parents unpacked and settled in, (p.s. If you're a tea drinker and you like a good brew, take your own teabags!!! And don't expect a kettle, you'll be boiling water by the pan) I gave it about 2 minutes and then my lovely hot shower started to get colder and colder until I had to get out because it just wasn't reheating, turns out the hot water runs on a tank which takes 2-3 hours to refill and then allows 2 minutes 6 seconds of hot water (I timed it) which as you can imagine is not enough for 3 people, especially a teenage girl (myself). We thought perhaps it's all okay and it'll all get sorted once we contact the key holder... Who surprise surprise couldn't do anything at all, and then trying to contact Interhome the people who deal with apartment, the replied quickly but didn't really do anything to help. On the second day we then lost all of our electricity for 3 hours! Thankfully there was a caretaker who managed to fix it and then an hour later our key holder turned up... Without an electrician... From then we were very careful with what electrics we were using incase it blew again. 2 weeks with an inadequate amount of hot water for 3 people and then chance of the electrics going isn't exactly our idea of relaxation.",Bad
"Horrible experience. My girlfriend has been robbed in front of main entrance to the hotel. Reception staff not helpful at all. Security guys ""disabled"",hotel not secured as well everyone can come  from outside by main entrance or from the poolside,food everyday the same and very poor ,drinks mostly water better all inclusive I have with my empty fridge. Animators interested just when weather conditions are ok.",Bad
"Horrible service in a quite nice hotel. + Horrible service: most of the staff (with few exceptions) were unhelpful and not at all friendly and polite
+ Woken up at 8:25am on Saturday morning by a cleaning lady - she knocked the door and as we did not answer she started ringing the doorbell
+ Woken several times before 9-10am by the horrible noise of tiling the floors around the apartment (a lot of work in progress going on over there)
+ Restaurant closes at 10pm - no place to get a drink after that time
+ Ants (later we had a huge bug and a lizard as well) crawling everywhere in the kitchen area
+ On our last day they run out of space to store the luggage so they put a bunch of luggage in one of the rooms. We were held for a lot of time (30min) in front of the door to collect our luggage after being told that someone will come to unlock in 2min. The luggage itself was not marked in any way to whom it belongs
+ On the last night (1am) there was a big fight going on in the next door apartment and we were the ones calling the receptionist to call the police. No one later came to apologize 
+ The Internet is not working - the signal was really poor in the apartment and the connection was getting lost every few seconds.",Bad
"Horrible service, not for strollers, good location.. 1.The service is extremely slow. We asked for a a cart or help with the luggage when we were checking out and waited for 45 minutes and no one came. We called the lobby twice and they said both times ""we are on our way to your room"". We ended up going three times from the room to the lobby (which was far away) to carry the luggage ourselves.
2. I would definitely not recommend this hotel for people with babies that use strollers. There are 10-30 steps to each apartment and it is hard to get the stroller and baby inside, especially if the baby is sleeping. 
3. Our bed was broken. It took 2 calls and one visit to the lobby to get that fixed.
4. Internet is only in the lobby. Not in rooms or pool area.
5. The furniture are very old and look very used. If you like 80's style, this might be something for you.
6. Gym is very poor and literally had one machine with weights.",Bad
"Hostel quality for a luxury price. The first day I had to wait over 90 minutes for my checkin, because our room was not ready. The staff gave me a voucher for a free drink at the pool bar, while I was waiting. But it was surprising that I was the only guest who was waiting for his room, why had I to wait so long if chekouts must be 2 hours sooner than checkins? Perhaps because they ask every 15 minutes for having another (not free) drink after the first they invited. Furthermore, the cleaning service was not satisfactory. I attach a picture of a long hair in the toilet whose position was changing every day (but was always there). But the worst of it all was the unpleasant smell, like a sewer, emanating from the toilet. It could be caused by the lack of a cover for the shower's evacuation system (as the attached pic shows), or the rift on the WC basis which also made it shake when anybody was sitting on it. When I asked for a solution they just confine themselves to regretting that the hotel needed some some renovations. Totally unacceptable.",Bad
"Hotel had plenty of restaurants and bars around.. We had a single bed between two people. We only stayed one night, went to go to bed and realised one bed was broken, only had 3 legs. Told hotel staff, just took note of it, didn't offer us a new room or new bed. Next day we wanted late check out (extra 3 hours) wanted to charge us 30 euro, which is fair if we had, had a proper service. Two of us had slept in a single bed (we arnt exactly slim) we didn't complain about it but they knew. You think they would let you have an extra 3 hours for free. Really we should if been moved rooms or new bed but none of that was offered, we had to share . Poor Experience.",Bad
"Hotel ok. Reception staff not very friendly. Pool and staff are excellent.. Food was not to our liking. This hotel is too Spanish orientated. 
We are Irish and found it hard to interact.",Bad
"How did this place get high ratings? Rigged?. - 4 people trapped in a room of 3x4m
- uncomfortable stretcher bed
- NO privacy (owners use room as walkway to own room)
- poor showering facility (handhold shower head/cold water (heated by sun), used by many people (estimate 10 people/1 shower)
- dirty furniture in common spaces outside and inside",Bad

"How important is a good customer service. Not happy with the hotel. Staff were not polite, had an incident with the wood panel of the air co unit, it fell off in front of us, breaking my suitcase, could have caused a massive injured if it wouldn't have happened seconds after, we were arriving to the room. I am still waiting for the hotel to replace my suitcase, the staff wasn't helpful on the night this happened at midnight, basically the reception lady was expecting that we stayed in that room with that unsafe condition, air co and telephone didn't work. We were asking for compensation but they have done anything about either, really bad service for the amount of money we paid for the room.",Bad
How is this a 4 star hotel?. Rooms though good size.... Beds very uncomfortable....poor wifi.... TV only 2 channels and sparking....thought it was going to explode.,Bad
I didn't like this hotel. I thought it was very shabby certainly not 4star nearer 2 star,Bad
"I do not recommend, all-inclusive not worth of money.. The room looks very used and oldish. There were peace of papers rolling on the ground for 2 days in front of the room and nobody was able to clean it. 
I don't recommend all-inclusive here, it's not worth of money. Although there was a plenty of choices, the quality of meal was very poor. All drinks at the bar only in plastic cups. Surroundings was not very nice, nearest nice sand beach it's 20 minutes by car.  I don't recommend.",Bad
"I don`t understand why this hotel has such a high rating.. I got an extremely small and dark room on the ground floor. The window was impossible to open and there was a small gap that was impossible to close. The room was under the hallway and I was woken several times during the night by people leaving or entering. But the worst was the bed, that is the most uncomfortable bed I have ever experienced in a hotel.",Bad

Handwash should have been provided in the toilet and washing up liquid in kitchen. Mop should have also been provided to clean the floor ourselves.  Hot water boiler was not working properly.
Swimming pool water was not heated although your description says ""heated swimming pool"".",Bad
I think the photos on the website are of a different hotel .... Decor poor. Smell terrible . Dated. Dirty . No air con . Bar in centre of hotel making it extremely loud at bed time ... all inclusive only till 11 ? Overpriced,Bad
I would not recommend area playa del ingles only good thin was bungalow s were nice. When i booked i requested 2 bungalows be together side by side when i got there we were not put together 5 or 6 bungalows apart i was very disapointed with that as i had teenage children our houses was a good bit apart,Bad
"Ideal for youngsters who want to sit around the pool and drink all day. Too far from town.

"If you are looking for comfort, relaxation and value for your money,  Labranda Isla Bonita not suit. No WI-FI in the room (No.530).
The maids only change towels, make the bed and close the curtains. A bathroom is not clean, bed linen is not changed. Linens changed only after 4 nights after being asked at the reception.
Air con in room didn't work.
Food plentiful, but monotonous. Big queues. 
Grounds at Plaza bar filthy, sticky to walk on.
""All inclusive"" - waste of money.
Economy class hotel. 3 * no more.",Bad
"If you expect a warm welcome and hospitality of Spain - you will not get it here. Unfriendly, unhelpful and miserable reception staff.

"If you like cockroaches and slow bar service, stay here!. Cockroach infested apartment and broken shower cradle. Reported to the hotel and said it would be sorted, neither were, we had to buy our own cockroach insecticide and hold the shower whilst trying to wash! Despite the hotel saying they would sort both problems out. Bar service was awful and slow, stood waiting for 5 minutes one day, good way for the hotel to save money on AI, but I was also purchasing non inclusive drinks too! Entertainment was dire and except for meat cooked during food service the rest was cold, thank heavens for the microwave.",Bad

"Location good, staff bad customer care, food average & rooms good if you get one with a pool view. We sent an email to the hotel prior to going to ask for a room with a view.I said we would be coming to celebrate my Husband's 65th birthday and our 44th wedding anniversary  I told them I wanted our room to be a bit special. On arrival we paid our money and then they gave us our key to our room The room was on the very lowest part of the hotel with no view or much day light. We immediately went and complained about the room and could we please have another one  The receptionist said no he could not change it because they were expecting more people arriving the next day We said that we should be given priority as we were already there. I mentioned my email with my request but this made no difference to him. We had to stay as it was getting late. In the morning we went to the reception to ask about changing our room  again we were refused. The receptionist said come back the next day and maybe the room could be changed but could not promise anything. The next day Monday in the afternoon we were finally given a better room.
Our celebration holiday was spoiled by staff that did not listen or care about us. The new room was better but there was no hand soap just liquid soap in the shower and we had to ask for that to be filled, no plug for the wash basin and the television never worked properly The receptionist said it was the Ariel but we spoke to other guests and they had no problem with their tv. The maintenance man came to fix it he said there was a problem and he would come back to fix it he never came back so we had to do without.   
The puddings were the same every day & the white wine was awful.",Bad
Location good.. desperated need for a revamped. it is stuck in the 1970's. the windows are rotten and drafty. kitchens and toilets are worn out. furniture old.,Bad
Location is excellent. Staff are rude and unhelpful.  Building works going on directly above our rooms.,Bad
"Location is spot on.. Wi-Fi is non existent even though it is advertised and marketed as a free Wi-Fi accommodation.  When I questioned reception they shrugged their shoulders and said it's always like this we hate it too. 
Next, the buffet breakfast is poor.
Finally, the evening entertainment is ridiculous. We ended up leaving the hotel every evening in search of something worth seeing.",Bad

no change of sheets during my stay ""7 days"" !!",Bad

"Main pool out of action due to SCHEDULED work. No prior warning, and no offer of compensation.. My Son and I recently returned from an 8 night stay at the Sunset Harbour Club
in Torviscas in Tenerife.
My first impressions of the hotel were good, and we looked forward to an
enjoyable stay.
I initially booked the hotel because it was in the area I wanted to be and I
really liked the idea of the chilled out, large pool, with pool-side bar.
Now, I was rather astonished to have a knock on our door a couple of days into
the holiday to be handed a print out explaining that scheduled work was to be
carried out on the main pool start from the very next day! — this wasn't
emergency work, this was SCHEDULED work, and followed a brief explanation that
during the 'low-season', work like this is often undertaken....
Now, I have been saving for our holiday for 2 years and at no time prior to the
leaflet was I told about these scheduled works (they were scheduled, not
emergency), and I was not given the opportunity to either book and accept it,
or find alternative accommodation; no, this was kept quiet and payment was
taken.
Even when we arrived at the hotel, we wasn't given the opportunity for a
full refund and an explanation about the works.
Selling holidays in this manner violates trade descriptions, where the item /
service offered, has not be given or provided under the full criteria
advertised — i.e. a large pool, with pool-side bar.
Not wanting to cause stress through conflict whilst away, and putting on a
brave face to make the best of it for my son and I, we radically altered our
plans to find alternative activities through the week.
I bought my complaint to the attention of both the Sunset Harbour club abd Booking.com; Booking.com did not respond and Sunset Harbour Club, merely said it was normal to carry out work during the 'off season'! this is Tenerife, it's a year round destination!
So basically, it was a tough c**p, we took your money knowing what we advertised was not going to be available.",Bad

- the arm chairs and sofas in the common areas were enticingly comfortable
- the location was central, a 5 minute walk from the nearest beach and 3 minutes from the nearest water park
- lunch and dinner were generally varied, with there always being something rather inedible but also lots of good stuff to choose from. The occasional dried out grilled meat was counterbalanced by the occasional stroke of genius, like the Mexican evening with lots of lovely food
- the waiters did not make a hassle at all about serving the right amounts of alcohol in our drinks. And I know that saving on alcohol by the staff can be a nuissance in other hotels with the all inclusive option.
- although the design of the pool area showed a lack of imagination by the investor or designer, it proved to be really well made concerning children.
- during most of the day, the lack of air conditioning was not a problem at all, due to the island's excellent climate.",Good

"Basic, but clean apartment complex with a great buffet and lovely staff. We were impressed by the food choices, plenty of different dishes and fresh every day. This was an all inclusive apartment style complex, some of which were also residential. The buildings themselves are a little dated, and the area was very quiet, run down in some parts, however the vibrant entertainment team and great food more than made up for that. We were there for only 4 nights, and wanted some winter sun and relaxation, without spending a fortune and that's what we got! The apartment was cleaned spotlessly every day, and was generally comfortable. The entertainment was varied and although the team didn't have a huge budget, they were so lovely and made everyone feel welcome. They had a fantastic paella and sangria making demonstration which we enjoyed, also things like flamenco and cabaret which was nice to watch after a huge dinner. There isn't a lot to do for families in this complex or in the area (a lot of more mature people), but if you want an affordable, quiet break then it's fine.",Good

Pool area clean and well managed. Rooms lovely and clean. Entertainment at night was varied, and sometimes, it was the guests entertaining more than the singers.  A lovely experience and our little one loved the pool, a great design of varied depths, so for her as a first time it was great. Pool bar staff very friendly. All staff very friendly.

"A pleasant introduction to a delightful island.. Delightful view from the balcony out to sea and the island of la Gomera, see photo. A quiet location with no through traffic; clean and well maintained throughout. The owner told us to visit los Gigantes, which was a pleasant surprise, we also visited Playa de San Juan, places where parking is easy and you don't get hustled. A good selection of food in the fridge and lots of free coffee. The place is well situated for visiting all points of the island and there are two good supermarkets at Adeje, about 6km to the south, you pass them on the way. Because we were tending to drive to different places each day we had little chance to explore the village to find food shops etc but it seems a pleasant place. Would go there again.",Good

"A realy nice trip in Tenerife. It is a great value for money. It has a great location (300m from playa jardin, 200m from the bus station, near the center, restaurants, supermarket, 10 minutes walking from loro park). I've enjoyed breakfast, it has plenty of food. We have also rent a car from the reception, so we had all we needed at this hotel. Tenerife has a lot of things/places to see and you don't have that much time to stay at the hotel (except for sleeping).For a traveler this is a great deal, a comfort place to stay, a good breakfast, take your backpack and go explore the island. If you are on honeymoon or you are looking for a place just to stay at the pool and drink cocktails you should search for a hotel in the south side of the island.",Good

Staff friendly and helpful at all times, and the housekeeping was efficient, cleaning the room 4 times in a week and a midweek change of bedding and towels. Plenty of hot water too. The resort, although simply furnished and equipped, has very pleasant gardens and attractive surrounds which were maintained to a high standard. 
A simple rustic feel at an economical price. Walking distance of Melonoras, the beach, and Playa Del Ingles if you don't mind a stroll.",Good

"A very welcoming hotel. The hotel is very convenient and close to beach and restaurant. The staff are wonderful especially Gorge at the desk. Very nice touches from the hotel like the free bottle of wine on arrival and free bottle of Cava on New Year's Eve.

"Holiday Club Puerto Calma and the Apartment are Excellent, except for bed comfort & Pool safety. The location of Club Calma on a hill overlooking the marina is absolutely brilliant, but it is up a steep hill but Taxis only cost €2.50 by day or €3.0 by night, The apartment was a reasonable size @ 62 m², it did not seem small with a very large balcony with brilliant views over the Marina. The safe, TV & A/C were very Good. The very large heated pool was great (most of the time). The cleaning lady did an excellent job.

We liked just about everything.. We liked just about everything. The staff in every department are as they should but often are not in a 5 star hotel. They give it the full whack and are a tribute to Iberostar. The rooms are smallish for 5 star but not uncomfortable. The shower unit in our room was inside the bath which could be difficult for the less mobile. There was the final touches to refurbishment that was discreetly carried out. Even so it was a little minus for a top quality hotel presumably charging top dollar. The food is of a very high quality in the massive general restaurant and in their three other more exclusive restaurants. Although the hotel caters for a great many guests it never felt overcrowded. We have the very highest regard for this hotel The only time we really fell out was when the room tv suddenly stopped a number of services particularly the football channel. Overall darned near perfect.,Good
"Wonderful with beautiful sunshine and nice friendly neighboures.. Had a very comfortable 3/weeks in Augustino Bungalow in March 2017.   One would almost think that this complex of 9/Bungalows facing west to south west set in a residential area  virtually looks after itself.   As the day goes by if you decide to stay in the Augustino Bungalow area the residential traffic becomes background noise and is only noticable when you wonder where is the traffic gone and then realise it is still there and of no consequence.   A special thanks should go to the professional maintenance staff that look after the Pool, the well manicured natural Grass and general cleaning of the Bungalows and grounds.  Congratulations to the proprieters for not using Artificial Grass which can become very tacky and a disaster for the natural wild life.   The wifii at Augustino Bungalows was very good.
Down the street towards the Jumbo you have a Restaurant on the left and on the right you have the Udaca Supermarket ran by very friendly staff.   Also in this area there is no shortage of pubs restaurant and terraces where you can sit back and enjoy refreshments or food.",Good

We had friends in a neighbor hotel, they were coming to ours for eating - you can come and eat - 14 euro per one.
4. You have to understand the difference between Puerto Rico and Maspalomas. Maspalomas is a town of hotels. There are nice places and views too,  but it is a town first of all. Puerto Rico is a place where you are in between mountains and ocean. It is more lazy and romantic place. We rented two cars so were very independent in researching the island - a lot to see if you don't like simple laying and getting sun.",Good

We'd stay there again. It's an old hotel with calm and character which they seem to be updating gradually. To begin with the cushions on the chairs in the indoor courtyard were a bit thin and showing their age, the next day all the chairs had been replaced with brand new ones and other cushions replaced with smart leather covered one's which looked and felt much better.",Good

"A few issues but we are still Gold Lovers. This was our second stay in Gold my partner & myself
We were disappointed that despite making our reservation for a Junior Suite well in advance on check in we was told they had overbooked the Junior suites so was given room 901. This is a standard room with a sea view.Its just that we had paid for a Junior suite. It was not until 2 days later I made a complaint saying it was not correct that we had paid for Junior suite. The next day we received a phone call from reception and was offered a refund for the difference between the standard room and the Junior Suite. This was acceptable to us.However I would recommend you email the hotel directly to make sure the room you have booked is the room you will be allocated on check in. I would like to point out that the standard rooms are very nice, the suites are just  more spacious.
On to the positives now, the staff are excellent, they will do there best to make your stay a special one.Special mentions to the reception staff Jose & Victor, both very pleasant and helpful. I would also like to mention Ester in the restaurant, always so happy at breakfast time.
The breakfast is amazing, so much choice and there is a breakfast chef who will cook omelettes for you. The bonus is its served right up to mid day!! 
There is free wifi throughout the hotel and most importantly in your room. The connection is fast about 70% of the time even for watching videos etc.
We requested a late check out but this was not possible because the hotel was full, which we totally understand but we were offered a courtesy room  for 30 minutes which enabled us to spend some time on the fabulous roof top terrace and jacuzzi before using the room to shower and get changed for our flight home.
As I said earlier it's our second stay and despite the issues we had we remain Gold lovers and will return",Good

"A very good hotel, with many strengths and some weaknesses. After spending one week at this hotel, our report is the following:
Strengths: 
•	Very good location, nice view over the ocean 
•	Excellent, large, heated pool
•	Our “family room” was very comfortable, very clean
•	Proper focus on small details, providing better comfort, such as good quality towel-dryer on the balcony
•	Classical hangers in the cupboard (not those “do-not-steel” uncomfortable, difficult to use variants, which are frequent in many hotels recently). This hotel trusts the guests that they are not steeling the hangers… 
•	Good restaurant facilities, perfect breakfast and dinner, with many choices of meals and fruits
•	Excellent fish meals, prepared freshly on spot
•	Very polite and helpful personnel
•	A rather large SPAR shop is very close, easy to buy water, food, drinks – if you need…",Good

The apartment was beautiful and rustic, true Canarian Spanish architecture and charming decor which had drawn us initially to the apartment in the first place. 
The cleanliness of the apartment was above and beyond and including all the mods and cons, some even brand new, boxed and un-used.  
The large double bed was so comfortable we found it hard to leave in the mornings, the sweet little patio was an ideal place to have breakfast and dinners. Although there is no air conditioning there are in ceiling fans to circulate air and due to the construction of the building it remains fairly cool.
Location wise it is very well connected with the buses so if you don't drive you won't have any trouble getting around, including the larger attractions such as Los Cristianos and Playa Americas. 
There is ample parking if you do drive.
We loved Las Galletas which is 30 mins straight walking up the road and is buzzing with nightlife, restaurants, small beach, tourist nic naks and bars - or 5 minute bus journey.
 There is a mini mart which supplies all needs (fresh bread, fruit, vegetables, deli with cheeses and meats, water, soft drinks and wine etc) only 5 mins walk from the apartment. There are also local restaurants like Casa Mary's offering typical Spanish food, a pizzeria and Bobby II - an Indian curry house.
We were offered a lift back to the airport for a small fee which really helped us out!
All in all a fantastic experience, I take great pleasure in recommending Los Moxianos to most Tenerife visitors - except for those who are looking for a 24 hour party, you'd best look for a resort.",Good

Golf course was in fantastic conditions. Not too  challenging. I would recommend to ask for a villa with a garage (only half of them have).,Good
"Beautiful, Clean, Modern, and Private. Alina was extremely helpful! The apartment was beautiful, clean and modern. Liked how there was 3 balconies, 3 TVs (one with Netflix, YouTube, etc.) and two pools within the complex. We used the pool each day and always had it to ourselves! Made use of the washing machine and oven which were both easy to use! Plenty of towels, extra linen and two fans in the apartment also! Apartment was in close proximity to a supermarket, 24 hour store, a couple of restaurants, bus stops to Siam mall, Siam park, and taxi ranks. On our last day, Alina let us keep our bags in the apartment until 2pm which was very helpful as we had an evening flight.",Good

"Best hotel in Costa Adeje. La Plantacion is a gem of a hotel in Tenerife. Five star and MOST of the guests reflect that. Full of smart Germans, Spanish and French. The English, as is so often the case, were a mixed bag. Going in the height of the summer though means lots of kids and babies- which wasn't so great. So if kids are not your thing don't go then! This is a chilled, chic hotel with a quiet air, so if you want lots to occupy your children or party of a night time this isn't for you.",Good

I felt the luxury and relaxation.
No British people found at all in this hotel.
The best area on the island for people who like the quite atmosphere, not many British in this area but we found lots of German and European people.
The south airport is 1 hour drive, but you can use the bus.
Best to come to north airport.
Book a car to see more places on the island, or stay in hotel with all inclusive and enjoy the sun.",Good
"Best pool area in Tenerife!. The best pool area I have experienced in Tenerife with plenty of beds, warm and cold pools, lots of greenery and views over the sea. The location is right on the seafront with a lift to the small beach and is a quieter area than nearby Costa Adele. Also liked large rooms with views over the sea and excellent selection at breakfast and dinner including vegetarian options. 
This is a much more chilled out (and nicer) hotel than the new Hard Rock across the road but work visiting the 16th floor rooftop bar across the road.",Good

We found the quality of the staff, their service, the standard of food and the exceptional broad range of facilities were all outstanding and could not be faulted. Apart from two rounds of golf at the nearby Maspalomas Golf Club - also an enjoyable course to play on - we didn't leave the hotel once.

"Amazing apartment, great views, lovely place.. This apartment is amazing, clean, spacious and a view that will impress anyone. We were met with the keys when we arrived and told about the local area, supermarkets and places to eat out. The beach is absolutely fantastic with pedalos, an inflatable 'wipeout' style assault course which our kids loved, and enough space to relax. The pool was very quiet, very private and refreshing (not as cold as previous reviews state). The apartment is on top of the hill which wasn't a problem for us, however a taxi is just 2 to 3 Euros if you do not fancy the walk back!
Beds are really comfortable, kitchen has everything you need, a free safe in the main bedroom, great bathroom and a huge south facing balcony which gets the sun from morning to late evening. 
There's an Aquapark about 25km away near Maspolomas which is great fun for a day out, and costs about 90 Euros for a family of 4. 
We hired a car, and although not really needed, helps out to have a look around some of the other areas. The local beach you see from the balcony is the best we found though. 
It really is an amazing apartment and we couldn't fault anything. If you book you won't be disappointed, we'd definitely return here.",Good

It is very close to the town and seaside.

OK, there are stairs if you want to go to the ""shopping centre"", but to be honest, I was really happy with it because I could go there and train in the mornings... it's not that bad as some people here state. There is a small shop at the bottom of the hotel, so if someone feels really lazy, he/she can shop there - they have loads of things.

There is both a child's and an adult's pool with ample sun loungers dotted around for those who wish to soak up the sun and those who want a shadier spot. The parasols are fixed to the ground, which means the loungers pretty much stay in their position all day. The duplex apartments are very well appointed with a microwave, toaster, kettle, coffee machine and more than enough pots and crockery than are needed for any self-catering holiday. The complex states there is no parking, however there is on-street parking directly outside and for those who don't hire a car, there are taxi's passing on a regular basis.",Good

"Awesome stay in Puerto Rico!. First and foremost hotel staff was super helpful. They fixed mess with room booking, helped us get around the island, helped us book, cancel and book tourist tours again (we cancelled booking at 10 pm and they were able to contact boss of tourist agency to give us our deposit back). It was probably the best and helpful staff we’ve meet in the hotel.
Location - it was great, 5 minutes walk to Puerto Rico beach and 2 supermarkets, 10 minutes walk to bus station and 15 minutes walk to shopping center.
Coffee and fresh juices makers in the room - it was very nice to enjoy coffee on the balcony. Plus fruits there are really tasty and you can make your perfect fresh juice.
Pool towels - free for use and you can change them an time you want.
Room cleaning - they did a great job cleaning the room and washing dishes.
Balcony view - it was very beautiful view on Puerto Rico and the bay. 
Drinking water in hotel - on the price of €2 it’s a nice deal to buy it in the hotel instead of carrying it from supermarket, were it costs €1.3-€1.6
Prices in hotel's restaurant and bar are the same as in the local restaurants, though we didn’t visit a lot of them.
Hotel staff organized airport transfer at the price of €55. It's a bit cheaper than local taxi and it was very fast and comfy - Mercedes Benz business class.",Good
